Dlrs. Results will be\\r\\nannounced on Tuesday. The 1985 net profit was 2.72 billion.\\r\\n    They forecast a final dividend of 29 cents for a total of\\r\\n42 cents for the year against 38 cents in 1985, adjusted for a\\r\\none-for-five bonus issue.\\r\\n    Analysts said they expected the bank to recommend a bonus\\r\\nissue this year, probably one for three or one for five.\\r\\n    The banks 61.5 pct subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd &lt;HSGH.HK>\\r\\nis to report its 1986 results on Friday.\\r\\n    Analysts expect Hang Seng to announce net profit of more\\r\\nthan one billion dlrs for the first time, an increase of 10 to\\r\\n12 pct.\\r\\n    They expect Hang Seng to pay a final dividend of 1.37 dlrs\\r\\nfor a total of 1.75 dlrs for the year against 1.60 in 1985.\\r\\n    Analysts said that while the use of undisclosed inner\\r\\nreserves by banks here makes forecasting very imprecise,\\r\\nHongkong Bank benefited from the unexpected strength of the\\r\\nHong Kong economy in 1986, when gross domestic product grew by\\r\\nnearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 4.5 pct.\\r\\n    They benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand,\\r\\nas their loan portfolio is well balanced, an analyst at Mansion\\r\\nHouse Securities (F.E.) Ltd said.\\r\\n    Government figures show that total loans and advances rose\\r\\nby 13.8 pct in 1986, compared with a 4.5 pct increase in 1985.\\r\\n    Loans to finance Hong Kongs visible trade, the mainstay of\\r\\nthe local economy, rose by 15.1 pct against a decline of five\\r\\npct in 1985.\\r\\n    Low interest rates also helped the bank. Interest received\\r\\non loans was low, with the prime rate at 6.5 pct at end-1986,\\r\\nbut interest paid on savings was two pct. Hongkong Bank and\\r\\nHang Seng Bank control half of all deposits in the banking\\r\\nsystem, giving them access to a large base of low-cost funds.\\r\\n    The strength of the real-estate market was another major\\r\\nincome source for the bank group. Loans to finance property\\r\\ndevelopment and instalment mortgages rose sharply.\\r\\n    The Hongkong Bank group is still the leader in mortgage\\r\\nbusiness despite tough competition from the Bank of China group\\r\\nand other foreign banks, one analyst said.\\r\\n    The high level of activity on the capital and equities\\r\\nmarkets in 1986 contributed to a sharp improvement in Hongkong\\r\\nBank subsidiaries Wardley Ltd &lt;WAIA.HK> and &lt;James Capel and\\r\\nCo>, analysts said. Wardley had a tremendous year acting as\\r\\nfinancial adviser and underwriter, an analyst said.\\r\\n    Wardley was underwriter for last years billion-dlr\\r\\nflotation of &lt;Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd>, of which Hongkong\\r\\nBank owned 30 pct at the time.\\r\\n    The banks stake has since been cut to 16.4 pct in return\\r\\nfor 1.57 billion dlrs. It also sold its entire 48.8 pct stake\\r\\nin &lt;South China Morning Post Ltd>, the larger of two\\r\\nEnglish-language daily newspapers here, for 1.18 billion dlrs.\\r\\n    The proceeds will go to reserves for acquisitions and will\\r\\nnot show up in the profit and loss accounts, analysts said.\\r\\n    Analysts said the bank had also been helped by a reduced\\r\\nneed to write off bad debts. The need for provisions was much\\r\\nlower than the year before, said Tony Measor of Hong Leong\\r\\nSecurities Co Ltd. Last years profits should have been 2.8 to\\r\\n2.9 billion dlrs if not for the huge provisions.\\r\\n    Former Hongkong Bank chairman Michael Sandberg said the\\r\\nbank wrote off hundreds of millions of dollars against its\\r\\nshipping exposure in 1985. Lesley Nickolds of County Securities\\r\\nAsia Ltd said she saw no major shipping writeoffs in 1986. She\\r\\nforecast profit of 2.99 billion dlrs.\\r\\n    The banks Latin American exposure, mainly through its\\r\\n51-pct owned Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM>, appears to have\\r\\nimproved substantially, analysts said. Marine Midlands 1986\\r\\nfourth-quarter loan-loss provisions fell to 44.1 mln U.S. Dlrs\\r\\nfrom 89.2 mln a year before. Its 1986 net profit rose to 145\\r\\nmln U.S. Dlrs from 125 mln in 1985.\\r\\n REUTER\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'HUGHES TOOL DIRECTORS REJECT MERGER WITH BAKER The directors of Hughes Tool Co\\r\\n&lt;HT> said they would recommend to shareholders that they reject\\r\\na merger with Baker International Corp &lt;BKO> today.\\r\\n    Hughes vice-president Ike Kerridge said the recommendation\\r\\nwould be put to shareholders at a meeting scheduled for 10 A.M.\\r\\nLocal time (1600 GMT) to discuss the proposed merger.\\r\\n    Kerridge said the board met yesterday to discuss the merger\\r\\nbut decided against it.\\r\\n    The Hughes board objected to a U.S. Department of Justice\\r\\nrequirement that Baker sell off several specialised\\r\\nsubsidiaries in businesses related to oil-drilling.\\r\\n    The Hughes board last week indicated that it might cancel\\r\\nthe merger because of the Department of Justice requirement.\\r\\n    The board of directors of the California-based Baker had\\r\\napproved the merger. On February 17 Baker said it had signed an\\r\\nagreement to sell one of the subsidiaries.\\r\\n    The companies had been given until April 22 to comply with\\r\\nthe Justice Department requirement, Kerridge said.\\r\\n REUTER\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'CANON INC (CANN.T) YEAR ENDED DECMEBER 31 Group shr 18.34 yen vs 58.72\\r\\n    Net 10.73 billion yen vs 37.06 billion\\r\\n    Pretax 27.76 billion yen vs 84.78 billion\\r\\n    Operating 30.06 billion yen vs 88.81 billion\\r\\n    Sales 889.22 billion vs 955.78 billion\\r\\n    Note - The company attributed the profit fall largely to\\r\\nthe yens appreciation during the period.

The agreement\\r\\nsimply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in\\r\\nTokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.\\r\\n    You have to look at the dollars peak compared with now,\\r\\nand that was well before Plaza, he said.\\r\\n    On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at\\r\\n263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was\\r\\n242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and\\r\\nperiodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the\\r\\ndollar trend has been down, down, down.\\r\\n    Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross\\r\\nrates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The\\r\\nEuropean currencies are moving back up against the yen.\\r\\n    The close relationship between exchange rates and trade\\r\\nflows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but\\r\\nundoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is\\r\\nchanging. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC\\r\\nboth grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.\\r\\nThis gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.\\r\\n    Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of\\r\\nof sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.\\r\\n    Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12\\r\\npct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports\\r\\nand 21 pct for imports in yen terms.\\r\\n    The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a\\r\\ntremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit\\r\\nsold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important\\r\\nto them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is\\r\\nlaying the golden egg, said de Hora.\\r\\n    The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year\\r\\nin Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its\\r\\nstart from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.\\r\\n    The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than\\r\\nU.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate\\r\\nimbalance, and which will cause problems.\\r\\n    This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is\\r\\nreflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But\\r\\ntherefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive\\r\\nedge, said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International\\r\\nEconomic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. If you want\\r\\nmy objective view, I dont expect a drastic improvement in our\\r\\ntrade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports,\\r\\nand this year we may have to do so again, he said.\\r\\n REUTER\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'THAI TIN EXPORTS RISE IN JANUARY Thailand exported 1,816 tonnes of tin\\r\\nmetal in January, up from 1,731 in December and 1,330 a year\\r\\nago, the Mineral Resources Department said.\\r\\n    It said major buyers last month were Singapore, Japan,\\r\\nBritain, the Netherlands, Malaysia and the U.S.\\r\\n REUTER\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'U.K. MONEY MARKET OFFERED EARLY ASSISTANCE The Bank of England said it had invited\\r\\nan early round of bill offers from the discount houses.

At the same time, the\\r\\ndecline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow\\r\\nthis year.\\r\\n    West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed\\r\\nadvances in domestic consumption and investment spending, both\\r\\nof which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary\\r\\npolicy, the institute said.\\r\\n    However, it said the labour market would see only a slight\\r\\nimprovement because companies will be reluctant to hire\\r\\nadditional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by\\r\\nagreed reductions in working hours.\\r\\n    The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of\\r\\nmonetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked\\r\\nacceleration of inflation.\\r\\n    It also warned that what it called the worldwide\\r\\nsynchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new\\r\\nglobal recession.

Some of them are too sophisticated to\\r\\nconvert into financial terms, one banking source said.\\r\\n    But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is\\r\\nimpossible to calculate.\\r\\n    They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Polands\\r\\neconomy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory.\\r\\n    Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under-\\r\\nachieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only\\r\\ncontributed to largely internal, economic problems, one said.\\r\\n    The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured\\r\\nNation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation\\r\\nfor suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under\\r\\nmartial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was\\r\\noriginally devised several years ago by the Institute of\\r\\nNational Economy, an offshoot of the central planning\\r\\ncommission.\\r\\n    According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish\\r\\neconomic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth\\r\\ntrends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in\\r\\ncredits from Western commercial and government lenders.\\r\\n    But the calculations were based on a time when trade was\\r\\nbooming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing\\r\\nthe estimate as a theoretical projection based on a high point,\\r\\nwhich has no real scientific evaluation.\\r\\n    A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to\\r\\nthe U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs\\r\\nannually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were\\r\\nimposed.\\r\\n    Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to\\r\\n200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade\\r\\nsurplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs\\r\\nagainst a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show.\\r\\n    Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important\\r\\nU.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles,\\r\\nchemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits\\r\\ndried up for economic not political reasons.  Poland is\\r\\naccusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for\\r\\npolitical reasons, said one expert. Its an illusion based on a\\r\\nmisunderstanding of Western economy.\\r\\n    Theres a limit to how much you can go on giving someone\\r\\nwho has no hope of repaying it, another said, adding that\\r\\nPoland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits\\r\\nin the 1970s which were no longer todays reality.\\r\\n    Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as nebulous, one\\r\\ndiplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders\\r\\nand setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of\\r\\nscientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say the\\r\\nlifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact\\r\\non Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs\\r\\nand lacks the means to modernise its industry.\\r\\n    MFN doesnt really mean anything, only that Poland will not\\r\\nbe treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to\\r\\nregain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are\\r\\nin play now, said one Western envoy.\\r\\n    He said Polish products were not competitive, and their\\r\\nquality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist\\r\\nmeasures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper\\r\\nPolands efforts to regain entry.\\r\\n    Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised\\r\\nthis fact recently.\\r\\n    Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, Making\\r\\nup our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly\\r\\ndifficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of\\r\\ntwo to three years it will be possible to increase the level of\\r\\nexports by only about 100 mln dlrs.\\r\\n    While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it\\r\\nhas a moral right to assistance from the U.S. Which it says\\r\\nimposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said\\r\\nThe argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing\\r\\nof the Polish economy wont cut any ice. The Americans will\\r\\njust reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing\\r\\nSolidarity.\\r\\n    Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, in\\r\\ntalks in Washington last week with the International Monetary\\r\\nFund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland was\\r\\nlooking for a lead from the United States.\\r\\n    He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its\\r\\nfinancial obligations to the United States, but not in a short\\r\\ntime and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its\\r\\nforeign economic partners.\\r\\n    He stressed that the U.S. had a particular opportunity to\\r\\nplay a part in the cooperative policy of Polands partners\\r\\ninterested in the settlement of Polish debt.\\r\\n    Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed\\r\\nWashington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF and\\r\\nParis Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and\\r\\nsaid it should now play a more positive role.\\r\\n    As a major superpower the United States can influence\\r\\ninternational organisations, he said, citing recent meetings\\r\\naimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to\\r\\nwhich Western nations were prepared to cooperate.\\r\\n REUTER\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'U.K. FOURTH QUARTER TRADE DEFICIT 2.6 BILLION STG Britain had a visible trade deficit of\\r\\n2.6 billion stg in the fourth quarter of 1986 against a revised\\r\\ndeficit of 2.9 billion in the third quarter, official\\r\\nstatistics show.\\r\\n    Seasonally-adjusted figures issued by the Central\\r\\nStatistical Office (CSO) show the current account was in\\r\\ndeficit by 760 mln stg against an upwardly revised third\\r\\nquarter shortfall of 930 mln.\\r\\n    For 1986 as a whole, visible trade was in deficit by 8.3\\r\\nbillion stg, sharply up from 1985s 2.2.

Shell Transport and Trading\\r\\nPlc &lt;SC.L> shares, the U.K. Arm of the group, rose to 11.39 stg\\r\\nfrom a close last night of 11.06 stg. Analysts noted that a\\r\\ngeneral collapse in exploration and production volumes was\\r\\npartially offset by earnings from chemicals rising to 462 mln\\r\\nstg from 205 mln in 1985.\\r\\n    Also, a windfall tax credit and lower than expected\\r\\ncurrency losses had added about 100 mln stg onto fourth quarter\\r\\nresults, which was the main reason for the figures exceeding\\r\\nforecasts, industry analyst Chris Rowland of Barclays de Zoete\\r\\nWedd noted.\\r\\n    However, he added there could well be a sharp fall in\\r\\nperformance in the first quarter of 1987, due to the\\r\\nimprobability that the group would be able to repeat the high\\r\\nrefining and marketing margins of first quarter 1986.\\r\\n    The impact of recovering oil prices would come through\\r\\nfaster on the downstream side than on the upstream as such a\\r\\nhigh proportion of upstream activity centred on gas, which\\r\\ntypically reacted to oil price changes with about a half-year\\r\\nlag, analysts said.\\r\\n    Holmes said that in the upstream U.S. Sector the third\\r\\nquarter of 1986 had been the worst of all.\\r\\n    Only two of the oil majors had managed to make a profit in\\r\\nthe period, with Shell Oil being one of them. The decrease in\\r\\nU.S. Earnings had been accentuated by tax rates but the group\\r\\nhad increased share to become volume market leader, Holmes\\r\\nadded.\\r\\n    Continued low crude oil prices would continue to subdue\\r\\nU.S. Exploration activity.

If\\r\\nyou are not exploring you are not going to find anything, he\\r\\nnoted.\\r\\n    U.S. Oil production had dropped some half mln barrels a day\\r\\n(bbd) in 1986 and would continue to fall if the price stayed\\r\\nbelow 20 dlrs a barrel.\\r\\n    This favored OPECs attempts to stabilise prices, as the\\r\\nlower the price the more likelihood there was of non-OPEC\\r\\nmarginal production shutting down.

They know\\r\\nthat controlling inflation will make industry more competitive\\r\\nand bring down unemployment in the long run, he added.\\r\\n    The head of another foreign bank said that only a month\\r\\nago, the Bank of Spain had dismissed his suggestion of a rise\\r\\nin reserve requirements, preferring to pursue its strategy of\\r\\nraising interest rates.\\r\\n    But bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now\\r\\n-- around eight pct for overnight funds -- was attracting money\\r\\nfrom abroad, strengthening the peseta and making Spanish\\r\\nexports less competitive.\\r\\n    The government says industrys competitiveness is also\\r\\nbeing hit hard by inflation. At 8.3 pct last year, the rate was\\r\\nway above that of Spains major trading partners in the\\r\\nEuropean Community, which it joined a year ago.\\r\\n    To help meet this years target of five pct, it is\\r\\ninsisting pay rises stay at that level, setting the stage for\\r\\nclashes with trade unions, who say they have made enough\\r\\nsacrifices.\\r\\n    Demonstrations by workers, students and farmers, whose\\r\\ndemands essentially involve more government spending, have\\r\\nbecome an almost daily occurrence. But Prime Minister Felipe\\r\\nGonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can.\\r\\n    Bankers said the reserve requirement increase could have\\r\\nsome impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit the\\r\\nmoney market too hard.\\r\\n    The Bank of Spain, which only yesterday raised its key\\r\\novernight call money rate to 13.5 pct, left it unchanged at\\r\\ntodays auction. The rate has been increased nine times since\\r\\nthe start of the year, when it was below 12 pct.\\r\\n    Bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise in\\r\\nany case with the end of the six pct maximium interest rate\\r\\nbanks can offer for time deposits of up to six months.\\r\\n    The measure will take effect tomorrow, following the\\r\\npublication of the decree in todays official gazette. Bankers\\r\\nsay the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and,\\r\\ninevitably, push lending rates higher.\\r\\n    A companion measure, reducing the proportion of funds which\\r\\nbanks must invest in specific areas, also takes effect\\r\\ntomorrow. Officials said when the cut was approved last month\\r\\nthat it was aimed partly at compensating banks for higher\\r\\ninterest rates.\\r\\n REUTER\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'GAMBRO AB &lt;GAMB ST> 1986 YEAR 133.5 mln crowns vs 101 mln.\\r\\n    Sales 1.61 billion vs 1.51 billion.\\r\\n    Proposed dividend 0.80 crowns vs 0.40 crowns.\\r\\n REUTER\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'TRANSPORTATION AGENCY GIVES FINAL OKAY FOR US AIR PACIFIC SOUTHWEST ACQUISITION\\r\\n ',0\\r\\n'S AFRICA MINE MANAGERS FACE CHARGES IN DISASTER Seven managers and employees at\\r\\nGeneral Mining Union Corp Ltds Kinross Mines Ltd will face\\r\\ncharges of culpable homicide following last years disaster\\r\\nwhen 177 gold miners died, the Attorney Generals Office said.\\r\\n    The mineworkers were killed last September at Kinross when\\r\\na fire set off toxic fumes which suffocated miners underground.\\r\\n    Three of the accused face alternative charges of breaking\\r\\nsafety regulations set out in the Mines and Works Act.\\r\\n    The spokesman said the case would probably be heard in\\r\\nWitbank Regional Court, near Kinross, in mid-May.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'WESTERN CANADA HURT BY INTERNATIONAL FORCES Western Canadas resource-based economy\\r\\nis being hurt by international market forces and there is\\r\\nlittle Ottawa can do about it, Finance Minister Michael Wilson\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n    If you can tell me how we can get the international energy\\r\\nprice up and how we can get the price for copper up and how we\\r\\ncan get the price for wheat up, then we will listen, Wilson\\r\\ntold the House of Comnons Finance Committee.\\r\\n    Although under pressure from oil companies and wheat\\r\\nfarmers for help in battling depressed commodity prices, Wilson\\r\\nsaid it has to be recognized the area was a prisoner of market\\r\\nforces outside the boundaries of this country.\\r\\n    Wilson, appearing before the committee to discuss the\\r\\ngovernments spending estimates released earlier this week,\\r\\nsaid the government is doing what it can in the region, citing\\r\\nmore than 3.5 billion dlrs in aid for western agriculture.\\r\\n    Those resources are a reflection of very real concerns on\\r\\nour part in dealing with a very difficult problem, Wilson said\\r\\nin response to questions about management of the economy from\\r\\nopposition party members.\\r\\n    He said the long term answer for depressed regions of the\\r\\ncountry was reaching a free trade pact with the United States,\\r\\nwhich he claimed would improve the outlook for Western Canada.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'AMERICAN SOFTWARE &lt;AMSWA> SETS STOCK SPLIT American Software Inc said its board\\r\\ndeclared a three-for-two stock split on Class A and Class B\\r\\ncommon shares, payable March 31, record March 16.\\r\\n    The company said it expects to increase its semiannual\\r\\ndividend 12.5 pct to six cts per share post-split from eight\\r\\ncts pre-split.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'COMDATA &lt;CDN> IN MERGER AGREEMENT Comdata Network Inc said\\r\\nit has entered into a letter of intent with a limited\\r\\npartnership managed by Welsh, Carson, Anderson and Stowe (WCAS)\\r\\nto merge Comdata into a corproration to be formed by WCAS.\\r\\n    Comdata said in the merger each share of the companys\\r\\nstock would be converted at the holders election into either 15\\r\\ndlrs in cash or a combination of 10 dlrs in cash and a unit of\\r\\nsecurities including common stock.\\r\\n    Comdata said the terms are subject to the condition that\\r\\nWCAS affiliate investors would own a minimum of 60 pct of the\\r\\nfully diluted stock of the new entity.\\r\\n    Comdata said WCAS and its affiliate investors would commit\\r\\n50 mln dlrs to buy the securities comprising the new entities\\r\\nunits of securities resulting from the merger in the same\\r\\nproportions and at the same price as the company shareholders.\\r\\n    Comdata said the move is subject to execution of definitive\\r\\nagreement and approval by Comdata shareholders as well as\\r\\nobtaining up to 200 mln dlrs in debt financing.\\r\\n    WCAS told Comdata it believes that it can get commitments\\r\\nfor this financing.\\r\\n   \\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'SOYBEAN GROUP HEAD URGES USDA ACTION ON LOAN The Agriculture Department must make\\r\\na decision soon on how to change the current U.S. soybean loan\\r\\nor more soybeans will continue to be forfeited to the\\r\\ngovernment and foreign soybean production will increase, the\\r\\npresident of the American Soybean Association, ASA, said.\\r\\n    The USDA will have to bite the bullet one way or another\\r\\n...

But critics have\\r\\nbeen warning for years that the constant exposure to the drugs\\r\\nis helping bacteria learn to resist the drugs.\\r\\n    Industry officials have disputed this, saying the diseases\\r\\nthat develop a resistance in cattle probably do not affect\\r\\nhumans.\\r\\n    But the new study, reported in Thursdays New England\\r\\nJournal of Medicine, shows the diseases can spread to humans.\\r\\n    The research team, led by Dr. John Spika, said the number\\r\\nof people who have developed the chloramphenicol-resistant\\r\\ninfection in Los Angeles County alone jumped from 69 in 1984 to\\r\\n298 the following year. Two of those victims died and half the\\r\\nvictims in their study of 45 patients had to be hospitalized\\r\\nfor their illness.\\r\\n    They also discovered that cooking the meat didnt always\\r\\nprevent the disease. Only 15 pct of the victims reported eating\\r\\nraw, infected hamburger. Thus, the researchers concluded, the\\r\\nmajority of cases appear to have been caused by eating\\r\\nhamburger that was at least partially cooked.\\r\\n    The researchers said the results show that food animals are\\r\\na major source of antimicrobial-resistant salmonella infections\\r\\nin humans, and that these infections are associated with\\r\\n(antibiotic) use on farms.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'EC REJECTS ALL FREE MARKET WHEAT EXPORT  OFFERS AT WEEKLY TENDER -

But by\\r\\nthen sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank of\\r\\nEngland, he added.\\r\\n    The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting\\r\\npressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sources\\r\\nsaid the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more\\r\\nthan just marking up by foreign exchange traders.\\r\\n    Meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentially\\r\\nharmful news on the trade front, todays figures showing that\\r\\nthe current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg.\\r\\n    This was above previous estimates of the current account\\r\\ndeficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985.\\r\\n    Fellner said that under more normal conditions this would\\r\\nhave given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that they\\r\\nwere too bullish to worry about such fundamentals.\\r\\n    The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing\\r\\nbanks divided as well as the markets. Privately, some bank\\r\\nofficials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for this\\r\\nweek, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow.\\r\\nIf a move comes before March 17, forecasts are for a half-point\\r\\ncut, with another half or full point about Budget day.\\r\\n REUTER\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'ENGELHARD CORP &lt;EC> SETS STOCK SPLIT Engelhard Corp said its board\\r\\ndeclared a three-for-two stock split and raised the quarterly\\r\\ndividend to 19-1/2 cts per share presplit from 19 cts, both\\r\\npayable March 31 to holders of record March 17.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'EGYPTIAN 1986 CRUDE OIL OUTPUT DOWN ON 1985 Non-Opec Egypt produced 40.3 mln tonnes\\r\\n(about 295 mln barrels) of crude in 1986 against 44.3 mln\\r\\ntonnes (about 323 mln barrels) in 1985, according to official\\r\\nfigures released today by the Egyptian General Petroleum Corp.\\r\\n(EGPC).\\r\\n    Officials say Egypt can produce up to one mln bpd per day,\\r\\nbut production was cut when world prices plunged last year.\\r\\n    In an attempt to help OPEC stabilize the world market,\\r\\nEgypt cut its 1987 production target of 940,000 bpd to its\\r\\ncurrent output of 870,000 bpd.\\r\\n    Egypt, which exports a third of its output, currently sells\\r\\nits top Suez and Ras Bahar blends for 17.25 dlrs a barrel.\\r\\n REUTER\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'SWISS ECONOMY IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, OECD SAYS Switzerlands economy, combining low\\r\\nunemployment, financial stability and a large external payments\\r\\nsurplus, is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory\\r\\nfuture, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\\r\\nDevelopment, OECD, said.\\r\\n    This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight\\r\\nfiscal and monetary policies followed by the government, it\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n    The OECD, in its annual report on Switzerland, picked out\\r\\nsome signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in\\r\\ninflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern.\\r\\n    The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product\\r\\ngrowth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986\\r\\nand a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct after\\r\\nlast years sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985.\\r\\n    But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest\\r\\nincrease in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rate\\r\\nunchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24-industrial\\r\\nnation OECD area.\\r\\n    Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs to\\r\\nthe dollar this year, against 1.69 in the second half of 1986,\\r\\nthe report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct\\r\\nrise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct\\r\\nrespectively in 1986.\\r\\n    The faster growth of imports compared with exports this\\r\\nyear and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meant\\r\\nthat the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP\\r\\nwould shrink in both years.\\r\\n    But given Switzerlands large external surplus, there\\r\\nshould be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than\\r\\nGDP...Which, if only in a small way, would contribute to\\r\\nimproving international balances, the OECD said.\\r\\n    Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually\\r\\nbuoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after several\\r\\nyears of relative weakness, it noted.\\r\\n    In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat\\r\\nto a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overall\\r\\nGDP, it added.\\r\\n    The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained\\r\\nbright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levels\\r\\nlast year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation\\r\\nin both the industry and service sectors, it said.\\r\\n    As a consequence, growth in machinery and equipment\\r\\ninvestment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year\\r\\nafter vigorous growth in 1986.\\r\\n    But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for\\r\\ntourism and the banking industry, two major service sector\\r\\nearners of foreign exchange.\\r\\n    The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc, and the\\r\\naccelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, could\\r\\nlead to a loss of international market share for both, it said.\\r\\n    Particularly for the banks, recent developments in\\r\\ninternational financial markets give rise to the question\\r\\nwhether the Swiss financial system, which has shown substantial\\r\\nflexibility in the past, is adapting itself at the speed\\r\\nrequired ...

The agreement\\r\\nsimply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in\\r\\nTokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.\\r\\n    You have to look at the dollars peak compared with now,\\r\\nand that was well before Plaza, he said.\\r\\n    On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at\\r\\n263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was\\r\\n242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and\\r\\nperiodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the\\r\\ndollar trend has been down, down, down.\\r\\n    Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross\\r\\nrates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The\\r\\nEuropean currencies are moving back up against the yen.\\r\\n    The close relationship between exchange rates and trade\\r\\nflows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but\\r\\nundoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is\\r\\nchanging. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC\\r\\nboth grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.\\r\\nThis gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.\\r\\n    Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of\\r\\nof sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.\\r\\n    Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12\\r\\npct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports\\r\\nand 21 pct for imports in yen terms.\\r\\n    The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a\\r\\ntremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit\\r\\nsold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important\\r\\nto them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is\\r\\nlaying the golden egg, said de Hora.\\r\\n    The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year\\r\\nin Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its\\r\\nstart from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.\\r\\n    The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than\\r\\nU.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate\\r\\nimbalance, and which will cause problems.\\r\\n    This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is\\r\\nreflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But\\r\\ntherefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive\\r\\nedge, said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International\\r\\nEconomic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. If you want\\r\\nmy objective view, I dont expect a drastic improvement in our\\r\\ntrade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports,\\r\\nand this year we may have to do so again, he said.\\r\\n REUTER...\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'TANDEM COMPUTERS &lt;TNDM> SEES HIGHER NET Tandem Computers Inc said it expects\\r\\nhigher earnings and revenues in its second fiscal quarter\\r\\nending March 31 against a year ago.\\r\\n    We feel we will continue to see higher growth in the\\r\\nquarter, James Treybig, president and and chief executive\\r\\nofficer, told a meeting of securities analysts.\\r\\n    In the second fiscal quarter last year, Tandem earned\\r\\n9,950,000 dlrs or 29 cts per share on revenues of 176.3 mln\\r\\ndlrs.\\r\\n    Treybig declined to offer specific projections for the\\r\\nquarter but he said the results might be lower than those for\\r\\nthe first quarter of fiscal 1987, when Tandem earned 27.1 mln\\r\\ndlrs or 58 cts a share.

The bill would allow farmers to forego planting and\\r\\nstill receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.\\r\\n    The administration has strongly urged that the bill be\\r\\nexpanded to feedgrains and to more than one year.\\r\\n    It is difficult to tell in what form the 0/92 provision\\r\\nwill emerge from the committee, the sources said.\\r\\n    Proponents of an expansion of 0/92 maintain there are large\\r\\nestimated cost savings of such a bill -- ranging from estimates\\r\\nby the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs.\\r\\n    Opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at this\\r\\ntime is the major reason cited by those against an expansion of\\r\\nthe bill, committee staffers said.\\r\\n    The 0/92 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 EST. A\\r\\nconflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting, and\\r\\nstaffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week.\\r\\n    Such a delay would not bode well for proponents of an\\r\\nexpanded 0/92 program, since spring planting in many areas of\\r\\nthe country will be underway in the next few weeks and signup\\r\\nfor the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends March 30.\\r\\n    Farmers are now making their planting decisions, so\\r\\nsomething has to be done quickly if a 0/92 program is to be\\r\\nimplemented, an Agriculture Department source said.\\r\\n    An expansion of 0/92 to feedgrains was opposed in last\\r\\nweeks subcommittee hearing on the bill, with subcommittee\\r\\nchairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., saying that more study of the\\r\\nconsequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings was\\r\\nnecessary.\\r\\n    Major commodity groups, including the National Corn\\r\\nGrowers, the American Farm Bureau and the National Cattlemens\\r\\nAssociation, have voiced strong opposition to 0/92.\\r\\n    But proponents of an expanded 0/92 argue that the bill\\r\\ncurrently is not equitable for all grains producers, so it\\r\\nshould be extended to other crops.\\r\\n    There will be difficulty in limiting 0/92 to wheat, said\\r\\nGene Moos, aide to house majority leader Tom Foley, D-Wash.\\r\\n    Projected cost savings, in the current atmosphere of try to\\r\\ndecrease farm expenditures, would also be hard to ignore in the\\r\\ndebate to expand the 0/92 application, Moos said.\\r\\n    Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Tex., may be planning to introduce\\r\\na bill to restrict 0/92 to only 1987 crop wheat, with the\\r\\nargument that now is not the time to vote in favor of any major\\r\\nchanges in the farm bill.\\r\\n    Stenholms bill is not a rejection of 0/92, only of the\\r\\ntiming, a congressional staff member said.\\r\\n    Rep. Arland Stangeland (R-Minn.) is reported to have an\\r\\namendment to expand the 0/92 provision to 1987 and 1988\\r\\nfeedgrains.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'YELLOW FREIGHT &lt;YELL> SEES LOWER 1ST QTR NET Yellow Freight System Inc said\\r\\nits expects 1987 first quarter profits to be substantially\\r\\nbelow the 14.2 mln dlrs or 50 cts a share earned in the same\\r\\nperiod a year ago.\\r\\n    Revenues have been depressed by recent price discounting,\\r\\nadded costs from expansion programs, lower shipping volumes and\\r\\nincreased costs associated with severe weather conditions\\r\\non the East coast, company officials told analysts here.\\r\\n    An industry-wide rate hike of 2.9 pct, set for April one,\\r\\nwill cover Yellow Freights upcoming labor and other costs but\\r\\nwill not make a contribution to operating margins, it said.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'NOVA SUBSIDIARY RAISES U.S. POLYETHYLENE PRICES Novacor Inc, a unit of &lt;Nova,\\r\\nan Alberta Corp>, said it would raise prices for U.S. customers\\r\\nby five cts a pound on linear low-density and low-density\\r\\npolyethylene, effective April 1.\\r\\n    The company did not immediately disclose the actual new\\r\\nprices.\\r\\n    A Novacor official later said in reply to an inquiry that\\r\\nthe new prices, effective April 1, would range from 31 U.S. cts\\r\\na pound to about 38 cts.\\r\\n    The official said the increase reflected improved market\\r\\nconditions, although he noted the new prices would still be\\r\\nlower than those of three years ago.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'MOULINEX STAKE SOLD TO SOME 50 INSTITUTIONS The 20 pct stake in Moulinex SA &lt;MOUP.PA>\\r\\nsold by &lt;Scovill Inc> of the U.S. Was spread among at least 50\\r\\ninstitutional investors worldwide, a spokesman for brokers\\r\\nJames Capel said.

The move complicated a USAir\\r\\ntakeover offer for Piedmont, which was believed to be close to\\r\\naccepting the bid.\\r\\n    Today, USAir rejected Icahns 52 dlr per share offer and\\r\\nsaid the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in its\\r\\ntakeover of Piedmont. Icahn was unavailable for comment.\\r\\n    Piedmont fell one to 68-5/8 on volume of 963,000. TWA was\\r\\noff 3/8 to 31-1/2. USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spread\\r\\nit would be taken over.\\r\\n    Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attempt\\r\\nto either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract a\\r\\nsuitor who might want both airlines once they merged.\\r\\n   The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer or\\r\\nPiedmont and USAir announce a deal, speculated one arbitrager.\\r\\n    Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current\\r\\nprice of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAirs bid will\\r\\nsucceed.\\r\\n    Piedmonts largest shareholder and other suitor, Norfolk\\r\\nSouthern Corp &lt;NSC> has offered 65 dlrs per share for the\\r\\ncompany. USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of\\r\\nPiedmont stock, and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance.\\r\\n    Some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price of\\r\\nPiedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is\\r\\ndestined to be acquired by someone. USAir, they said, is the\\r\\nleast likely to be bought.\\r\\n    Icahn, who has long talked about further consolidation in\\r\\nthe airline industry, also offered USAir the alternative of a\\r\\nthree-way airline combination, including TWA and Piedmont.\\r\\n    But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahns\\r\\noffer, which lacked financing and was riddled with\\r\\ncontingencies.\\r\\n    Still, he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two\\r\\nairlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA.\\r\\n    You cant discount him, said one arbitrager.\\r\\n    Analysts, however, said Icahn would have to prove he is\\r\\nserious by following through with his threats or making a new\\r\\noffer. In making the offer for USAir, Icahn threatened to go\\r\\ndirectly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lower\\r\\nprice if USAir rejected his offer.\\r\\n    Its clear Icahn wants to sell and hes bluffing, said\\r\\none arbitrager.\\r\\n    Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced by\\r\\nabout six dlrs per share.\\r\\n    Some analysts believe Icahns proposed three-way airline\\r\\ncombination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles, but\\r\\nothers believe it could be cleared if the companies are\\r\\nacquired separately.\\r\\n    TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal to\\r\\nwork, said one analyst.\\r\\n    Analysts said such a merger would be costly and\\r\\ncomplicated. TWA has the best cost structure, since Icahn\\r\\nsucceeded in winning concessions from its unions.\\r\\n    In order for the other carriers to come down to TWAs wage\\r\\nscale in a merger, TWA would have to be the surviving entity,\\r\\nanalysts said.\\r\\n    Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA, they\\r\\nsaid. They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines\\r\\ncosts when he merged it into TWA last year, and he might be a\\r\\nnecessary ingredient for a merger to work.\\r\\n    However, other analysts speculated the managements of\\r\\nPiedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a new\\r\\ncompany. They said a USAir acquisition of TWA might be a way\\r\\nfor him to exit the company if USAirs airline is then merged\\r\\ninto TWA.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'BAKER INTL &lt;BKO> HOPES TO COMPLETE MERGER Baker International Corp treasurer Eric\\r\\nMattson said the company hoped to iron out snags in a proposed\\r\\nmerger with Hughes Tool Co &lt;HT> but declined to say if or what\\r\\ncompromises might be acceptable to it.\\r\\n    The proposed merger that would create a 1.2 billion dlr\\r\\noilfield services company was thrown into limbo yesterday when\\r\\nHughes management, balking at the terms of a government consent\\r\\ndecree, offered a counter-proposal to Baker.\\r\\n    Earlier today, Hughes adjourned a shareholders meeting\\r\\ncalled to vote on the proposed merger until March 11 and said\\r\\nit hoped to resume negotitations with Baker.\\r\\n    Hughes chairman W.A.

At midday today Hughes said\\r\\nit was still interested in the merger.\\r\\n    The analysts also said Hughes may be worried that its\\r\\ntroubles could make it a takeover candidate.\\r\\n    There was speculation today that Harold Simmons, the Dallas\\r\\ninvestor, might try to acquire Hughes, but Simmons told Reuters\\r\\nhe is not interested.\\r\\n    Simmons said he intends to file a 13-D with the Securities\\r\\nand Exchange Monday reporting a stake of five pct or more in\\r\\nsome publicly traded company. He declined to identify the\\r\\ntarget other than to rule out Hughes.\\r\\n    One analyst said another factor in the latest Hughes\\r\\nturnabout was Borg-Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, which owns 18.5 pct of\\r\\nHughes. Borg-Warner ex-chairman J.F.

He said the merger lost a\\r\\nlot of its appeal when the U.S. Department of Justice required\\r\\nthat Baker sell off its Reed Tool Co operation.\\r\\n    Although the Reed operation is relatively small in view of\\r\\nthe total size of a combined Baker-Hughes, Pace said 30 to 40\\r\\npct of the cost savings are tied up in that.\\r\\n    They (Hughes) are obviously concerned about the lawsuit,\\r\\nsaid James Crandell, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.\\r\\nApparently they are willing to continue discussions but\\r\\nwhether they will alter their position, I dont know.\\r\\n    Its getting a little confusing, said James Carroll,\\r\\nanalyst at PaineWebber Group Inc. He said the arguments cited\\r\\nby Hughes yesterday for not doing the merger tend to be weak.\\r\\nHughes said yesterday that as a condition of the merger it\\r\\nwanted Reed Tool and other businesses sold prior to April 22,\\r\\nthe projected merger date. A government decree allowed a longer\\r\\nperiod of time.\\r\\n    Hughes contended it was better to formally combine the\\r\\ncompanies with the status of Reed already settled.

Hopefully, they will now start to cut\\r\\nback production to get supplies in line with demand, he added.\\r\\n    With futures down, processors are finding they must bid\\r\\npremiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins.\\r\\n    A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 cents\\r\\nfor every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, down\\r\\nsharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below\\r\\nthe average cost of production, cash dealers said.\\r\\n    Most soybean processing plants are still in operation, with\\r\\nlittle talk of taking temporary down-time, so far.

But there is no\\r\\nway they can trade their way out of this situation, Aldo\\r\\nRoldan, Vice President for International Services at Chase\\r\\nEconometrics, said.\\r\\n    Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the\\r\\nproblems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted\\r\\nworld markets, but also had to work to make its position on\\r\\nforeign exchange markets more profitable.\\r\\n    Domestic costs have increased (due to inflation) and\\r\\nexporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange\\r\\nrates, Roldan said.\\r\\n    The Chase economist also said commodities markets were\\r\\ndepressed and generally did not appear very promising for a\\r\\ncountry like Brazil, where pure commodities account for some 50\\r\\npct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23\\r\\nbillion dlrs.\\r\\n    But he added: They are always pretty aggressive and they\\r\\nhave good foreign marketing channels.\\r\\n    Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be\\r\\ncoffee, and even without background pressure from foreign\\r\\ncreditors the worlds largest producer was expected to hit the\\r\\nmarket this year with a vengeance.\\r\\n    Negotiations between International Coffee Organization\\r\\n(ICO) members to re-establish producer export quotas broke up\\r\\nearlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing\\r\\neach other of intransigence.\\r\\n    Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations,\\r\\nwhich others wanted changed, one senior coffee dealer said.\\r\\n    The dealer, who declined to be named, said Brazil wanted to\\r\\npreserve its market share. At the end of the talks, he said\\r\\nBrazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others\\r\\nwould suffer.\\r\\n    Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but\\r\\nas yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales, the\\r\\ndealer said.\\r\\n    If they do come into the market at this level it will go\\r\\nlower and you could breach a dollar, ninety or eighty cents,\\r\\nhe said.\\r\\n    New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2.29 cents\\r\\nlower Thursday at 104.68 cents a lb, while more distant\\r\\ndeliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit.\\r\\n    President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, Jorio Dauster\\r\\ntold a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has\\r\\nno set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of\\r\\nthe ICO talks on export quotas.\\r\\n    Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the\\r\\nfocus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts. They\\r\\nwill be more aggressive this year than they have ever been,\\r\\naccording to Richard Loewy, analyst for Prudential-Bache\\r\\nSecurities Inc.\\r\\n    Loewy believes the foreign debt problem, a good crop, plus\\r\\ndifficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the\\r\\nBrazil soybean crop. Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and\\r\\nthey cant afford to store the crops, he said.\\r\\n    The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time\\r\\nabout large South American crops developing under near ideal\\r\\nconditions towards record yields.\\r\\n    We are going to see a very rapid decline, earlier than\\r\\nusual, this year in our (U.S.) exports, Loewy said.\\r\\n    Tommy Eshleman, economist for the American Soybean\\r\\nAssociation (ASA), said this years Brazilian soybean harvest\\r\\ncould total 18 mln tonnes, versus 13.7 mln last year.\\r\\n    Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices\\r\\nare usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the\\r\\nvulnerability of the U.S. crop to bad growing weather.\\r\\n    Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a\\r\\nreduction in the U.S. government soybean loan rate, offered to\\r\\nfarmers who give crops as collateral, Eshleman said.\\r\\n    He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the\\r\\nsoybean loan rate, which acts as an effective floor for prices\\r\\nby keeping supplies away from the free market. Farmers can\\r\\nforfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the\\r\\nloan.\\r\\n    Were getting into a period when they (Brazil) are\\r\\nstarting to harvest and starting to export, Eshleman said. But\\r\\nhe added it will be a while before U.S. exports fall to below\\r\\n10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently.\\r\\n    Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel\\r\\nBurnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much\\r\\nas it can this year because of its economic situation.\\r\\n    He said the debt situation was a major consideration. The\\r\\nBrazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for\\r\\nstorage, he added.\\r\\n    Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil\\r\\nwould make farmers inclined to hold onto crops, Melicias said\\r\\nit would not make a big difference.\\r\\n    On other commodity markets, Brazils selling impact may be\\r\\nmuted no matter its need to generate capital.\\r\\n    Brazil is faced with a poor 1986/87 sugar harvest, which\\r\\ncould limit exports to the world market, analysts said. The\\r\\ncountry may have oversold and be unable to honor export\\r\\ncommitments, and this plus higher domestic demand caused by\\r\\nconsumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar, will\\r\\ngive it little room to stretch exports, they said.\\r\\n    Brazils other major crop, cocoa, is in its third year of\\r\\nsurplus. Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it\\r\\nfell, so I dont think they can start throwing out cocoa and\\r\\nfind many more markets for it, one analyst said.\\r\\n    If they come out as aggressive sellers, the market would\\r\\ncollapse and they cant afford to do that, she added.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'IEA SAYS OPEC FEBRUARY CRUDE OUTPUT 16.1 MLN BPD OPEC produced an average 16.1 mln barrels\\r\\nper day (bpd) of crude oil in February, down from 16.5 mln the\\r\\nprevious month and an overall 17.3 mln bpd in fourth quarter\\r\\n1986, the International Energy Agency said.\\r\\n    A few OPEC countries last month exceeded the production\\r\\nquotas set at their last conference in December, but liftings\\r\\nwere reduced from several countries, it said in its latest\\r\\nmonthly oil market report.\\r\\n    These cutbacks were due in part to buyer resistance to\\r\\nfixed prices, introduced from February 1, particularly for\\r\\nfixed volumes over an extended period.\\r\\n    It gave this breakdown for OPEC crude output, in mln bpd\\r\\n                    FOURTH QTR 1986  JANUARY 1987  FEBRUARY\\r\\n1987\\r\\n    SAUDI ARABIA    4.9              3.7           3.8\\r\\n    IRAN            1.6              2.2           1.9\\r\\n    IRAQ            1.6              1.6           1.7\\r\\n    UAE             1.3              1.2           1.2\\r\\n    KUWAIT          1.0              1.0           1.0\\r\\n    NEUTRAL ZONE    0.5              0.4           0.4\\r\\n    QATAR           0.3              0.3           0.2\\r\\n    NIGERIA         1.3              1.2           1.2\\r\\n    LIBYA           1.0              1.0           1.0\\r\\n                    FOURTH QTR 1986  JANUARY 1987  FEBRUARY\\r\\n1987\\r\\n    ALGERIA         0.6              0.6           0.6\\r\\n    GABON           0.1              0.2           0.2\\r\\n    VENEZUELA       1.6              1.6           1.6\\r\\n    ECUADOR         0.2              0.2           0.2\\r\\n    INDONESIA       1.3              1.2           1.2\\r\\n    TOTAL           17.3             16.5          16.1\\r\\n    The IEA said while Saudi production stayed below its quota\\r\\nof 4.133 mln bpd, actual sales might exceed output due to\\r\\nNorbec stock disposals.

But there was a clearly\\r\\njustified need for them. There was nothing ominous.\\r\\n    The Fed couldnt have waited until the start of the new\\r\\nstatement period today. If it had, it would have missed its\\r\\n(reserve) projections, added Security Pacifics Bannon.\\r\\n    A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no large\\r\\nsingle-day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week.\\r\\n    Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher-than-\\r\\nexpected adjusted bank borrowings from the Feds discount\\r\\nwindow, which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week,\\r\\ncompared with many economists forecasts of about 200 mln.\\r\\n    For the two-week bank statement period as a whole, the\\r\\ndaily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from\\r\\n160 in the prior period.\\r\\n    There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday and\\r\\nWednesday, so I am not too bothered about the borrowings, said\\r\\nScott Winningham of J.S. Winningham and Co. The Wednesday\\r\\naverage rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier.\\r\\n    Lending further support to the stable policy view was a\\r\\nrelatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the\\r\\nlatest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in\\r\\nthe banking system, economists said.\\r\\n    For the time being, the Fed is following a neutral path,\\r\\nwith fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct, said Darwin Beck of\\r\\nFirst Boston Corp.

We have the\\r\\nimpression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth\\r\\nthis year.\\r\\n    The big question is whether the governments policy of wage\\r\\nmoderation will be maintained, he added.\\r\\n    The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout\\r\\n1.7 per cent this year, with a three per cent ceiling for rises\\r\\njustified by increased productivity.\\r\\n    But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation, Edmond\\r\\nMaire, meeting with Chirac today, renewed union demands already\\r\\nrejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built\\r\\ninto future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher\\r\\nprices.\\r\\n    Calling the governments policies unbalanced and unjust, he\\r\\nalso demanded investment incentives to boost employment. He\\r\\nannounced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the\\r\\ngovernment would spend two billion francs on a series of\\r\\nmeasures to boost employment and training\\r\\n    Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderate\\r\\nForce Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chirac\\r\\nearlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT, the largest of\\r\\nFrances unions, declared the defence of its members earnings\\r\\nits top priority.\\r\\n    But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, and\\r\\nstill rising, government supporters and some economic analysts\\r\\nsaid they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands.\\r\\n    Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist\\r\\ngovernment and I dont think this administration is going to\\r\\nreverse that, commented Michel Develle, economist at\\r\\nrecently-privatised Banque Paribas.\\r\\n    Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas\\r\\nand the New Year, partly blamed by the government for higher\\r\\ninflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, he\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n    Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more\\r\\nthan the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7\\r\\nper cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent.\\r\\n    But that would still be an exceptional achievement\\r\\nconsidering that for the first time since the Second World War\\r\\nall french prices have been freed, he commented.\\r\\n    Finance Ministry officials said that the governments\\r\\nabolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible\\r\\nfor nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January living\\r\\ncosts.\\r\\n    But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should\\r\\nhave no knock-on impact on the rest of the year.\\r\\n    Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that, so long\\r\\nas the government kept wages under control.\\r\\n    Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of\\r\\n1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally more\\r\\nthan forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute,\\r\\nINSEE,  Marais said. But the second half year should be better,\\r\\nhe added.\\r\\n    Ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be to\\r\\nhelp the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget\\r\\ndeficit, several analysts said.\\r\\n    So long as public sector wages are held down, higher Value\\r\\nAdded Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a\\r\\nloss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than\\r\\nexpected growth, they said.\\r\\n   \\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'MEXICO SUSPENDS OVERSEAS COFFEE SALES Mexico has temporarily suspended\\r\\noverseas coffee sales due to falling prices triggered by the\\r\\nfailure of the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) meeting\\r\\nto agree a quota system at its latest meeting, the official\\r\\nNotimex news agency said.\\r\\n    Were just waiting a while for prices to improve, an\\r\\nunidentified Mexican trader told the agency.\\r\\n    Mexico has already sold 80 pct of its export coffee\\r\\nproduced in the year to last September, the source said.

This is going to raise some eyebrows\\r\\nat the Fed, McCarthy said.\\r\\n    Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc added, We\\r\\nhave some very good-looking monetary aggregate data. Its\\r\\ncoming in a lot weaker than I thought.    \\r\\n    The economists were quick to caution that one months data\\r\\nprove nothing, especially because money growth previously had\\r\\nbeen so rapid. M-1 in the last 52 weeks has grown at a 16.7 pct\\r\\nrate and at a 19.1 pct rate in the past 13 weeks.\\r\\n    Moreover, some of the contraction in M-2 can probably be\\r\\nexplained by a shift of funds from savings vehicles into the\\r\\nbooming stock market and is thus not an indication of a\\r\\nslowdown in the business expansion.\\r\\n    But the data raise the tantalizing possibility for the bond\\r\\nmarkets that the slowdown in money growth is partly a\\r\\nreflection of a weaker economy that needs more Fed stimulus.\\r\\n    McCarthy noted that the slower money growth coincides with\\r\\nsigns that the economy is losing momentum as the quarter\\r\\nprogresses. Some of the economic indicators are not as rosy as\\r\\nthey were a month ago, he noted.\\r\\n    He expects only five to six pct M-1 growth in March and\\r\\nrises in M-2 and M-3 of about four pct.\\r\\n    Slifer sees stronger growth of 10 pct in M-1 and five pct\\r\\nor less for M-2 and M-3, but the rates would still be moderate\\r\\nenough to encourage the Fed to ease policy if gross national\\r\\nproduct for the first quarter proved to be weak. Youd\\r\\ncertainly be more inclined to ease than you would in the past.\\r\\n    There was certainly nothing in the Feds latest balance\\r\\nsheet, however, to suggest a change of policy is already under\\r\\nway, economists said.

This follows a\\r\\n319,000 gain in January, revised down from a previously\\r\\nreported 448,000 increase.\\r\\n    Even if you look at January and February together, this is\\r\\nstill a much stronger report than the consensus expectation in\\r\\nthe market, said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation.\\r\\n    Economists stressed that gains in hours worked signal much\\r\\nlarger gains in February U.S. production and income than\\r\\npreviously forecast.\\r\\n    The average work week rose 0.2 hours to 35.0 hours from\\r\\n34.8 hours in January. The average manufacturing work week rose\\r\\n0.3 hours to 41.2 hours, the longest factory work week since\\r\\nNovember 1966, the Commerce Department said.\\r\\n    The gains in manufacturing employment point to a very\\r\\nlarge increase in industrial production of between 0.5 and 0.7\\r\\npct, said Joe Carson of Chemical Bank. This compares to a 0.4\\r\\npct  gain in January U.S. industrial production.\\r\\n    Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co Inc\\r\\nnoted that the average wage rate increased to 8.87 dlrs an hour\\r\\nin February from 8.83 dlrs in January.\\r\\n    Combined with the increase in hours worked, this means\\r\\nwell get a pretty healthy gain in personal income vis-a-vis\\r\\nthe wage and salary disbursement, he said.\\r\\n    Greenbaum said that February U.S. personal income should\\r\\nrise at least 0.5 pct after being flat in January.\\r\\n    He said the February employment gains are consistent with\\r\\nhis firms first quarter U.S. real gross national product\\r\\ngrowth forecast of 3.7 pct.\\r\\n    Economists agreed that the employment data were negative\\r\\nfor the credit markets in that they signal a healthier economy\\r\\nand no easing in the Federal Reserves monetary policy. But\\r\\nmost said that the market need not fear tighter policy either.\\r\\n    This report is another reason for the Fed to not consider\\r\\neasing, said Ray Stone of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.  \\r\\n  It gives them more room to address the dollar situation, he\\r\\nsaid. If they had to nudge policy tighter, they could do so,\\r\\nbut its most likely theyll sit and wait.\\r\\n    The data have not been uniform, Stone added. Durable\\r\\ngoods were weak in January and now employment is strong.\\r\\n    In January, U.S. durable goods orders dropped 7.5 pct,\\r\\nfollowed by a 4.0 pct drop in U.S. factory goods orders. U.S.\\r\\nretail sales fell 5.8 pct, and the U.S. merchandise trade gap\\r\\nwidened to 14.8 billion dlrs.\\r\\n    Things just arent adding up, said Steve Slifer of Lehman\\r\\nGoverment Securities Inc. Consumer spending, capital spending,\\r\\ngoverment spending, and net exports data show very weak first\\r\\nquarter GNP growth of one pct, he said.\\r\\n    The employment and production data point to a big\\r\\ninventory build-up, but thats what we thought in the fourth\\r\\nquarter and we only got 1.3 pct GNP growth.\\r\\n    Manufacturing employment gained 50,000 after falling 15,000\\r\\nin January. Economists estimated that 30,000 of the gain was\\r\\naccounted for by striking workers in the steel and machinery\\r\\nindustries returning to work.\\r\\n    Even so, some economists said that the manufacturing gains\\r\\nhave resulted from an improving trade outlook.\\r\\n    Jason Benderly of Goldman, Sachs and Co noted that the U.S.\\r\\ntrade picture improved in the fourth quarter as net exports\\r\\ngrew at a 20 pct annual rate while the rate of increase in\\r\\nimports fell to only six pct, and that it continues to improve\\r\\nin the first quarter.\\r\\n    Not only the official statistics for the fourth quarter,\\r\\nbut evidence of a pick up in orders from overseas for paper\\r\\nproducts, chemicals, high-tech goods, and capital goods show\\r\\nthat trade is improving, Benderley said.\\r\\n    The economy is moving between extremes, he said. Some\\r\\nreports are going to look bad and some good, but first quarter\\r\\nGNP is going to grow in the middle at about three pct.\\r\\n    A 287,000 gain in services employment comprised the greater\\r\\npart of Februarys employment gain. Retail services employment\\r\\nrose 129,000 in February, compared to a gain of 117,000 in\\r\\nJanuary, previously reported at 166,000.\\r\\n    Construction employment rose a slim 2,000 in February. But\\r\\nthis follows a robust 113,000 gain in January, revised down\\r\\nfrom a previously reported 142,000 gain.\\r\\n    The U.S. civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in\\r\\nFebruary at 6.7 pct. This means the jobless rate has stayed at\\r\\n6.7 pct for three consecutive months, the lowest reading since\\r\\nMarch 1980, the Commerce Department noted.\\r\\n    The Federal Reserve has to be pleased with this report,\\r\\nCarson said.

International Monetary Fund team there is\\r\\nscope for further cuts in 1988.\\r\\n    The suggestion is contained in the preliminary conclusions\\r\\nof the annual IMF consultations with Belgium on its economic\\r\\npolicy, a copy of which was distributed to journalists at the\\r\\nweekly press conference following meetings of the cabinet.\\r\\n    The IMF team also urges Belgium to adopt a firm interest\\r\\nrate policy, with a particular emphasis on long-term rates.\\r\\n    The teams report to the government praises last years\\r\\nspending cuts, which are due to reduce 1987 government spending\\r\\nby 195 billion francs, and says 1986 saw the Belgian economy\\r\\nperform better, on a broader basis, than at any time so far in\\r\\nthe 1980s.\\r\\n    However, it adds that with lower inflation, stabilisation\\r\\nof the debt to gross national product ratio requires a much\\r\\nlower budget deficit than the seven pct of GNP target the\\r\\ngovernment has set itself for 1989.\\r\\n    The governments net financing requirement was 11.0 pct of\\r\\nGNP in 1986.\\r\\n    The report says The most that can be afforded over the next\\r\\nfew years is a zero growth of real non-interest expenditure of\\r\\ngeneral Government.\\r\\n    It says there is a need for a revision of the Belgian tax\\r\\nsystem to iron out distortions and meet hopes of a reduced tax\\r\\nburden but substantial progress is needed in stabilising the\\r\\ndebt to GNP ratio before this is possible.\\r\\n    Because of the difficulty of sustaining zero expenditure\\r\\ngrowth and of likely growing impatience (for) tax reductions,\\r\\nwe feel that your position would be stronger if you could\\r\\ndecide on rather sharp expenditure reductions in 1988, the\\r\\nreport adds.\\r\\n    The IMF urges a strong interest rate policy to signal the\\r\\ngovernments determination to keep its currency strong and to\\r\\ncurb inflation.\\r\\n    It says firmer long-term rates would slow private net\\r\\nlong-term capital outflows, which increased strongly in 1986.\\r\\n    It also urges net repayments of foreign currency debt and\\r\\nan overhaul of domestic capital markets to facilitate

The question is\\r\\ntherefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting.\\r\\n    Paul Temperton, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Europe\\r\\nLtd, estimated that the government wanted to see the\\r\\ntrade-weighted index about 72-73 pct. Even after this action\\r\\nover the last few weeks, sterlings only just within striking\\r\\ndistance of that range, he said.\\r\\n    Other analysts agree that the government probably has some\\r\\nbroad target range around this area.\\r\\n    However, they said Lawson would be prepared to see the\\r\\npound go higher at least in the short term, despite the risk of\\r\\na loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports.\\r\\n    If the Bank of England keeps the interest rates as they\\r\\nare, whats to stop it (going higher), said John Cox, executive\\r\\ndirector of EBC Amro Bank Ltd, a major operator on the London\\r\\nforeign exchange market.\\r\\n    Cox estimates that the Bank of England has been active\\r\\nselling sterling over the past few days, despite the lack of\\r\\ngeneral market talk of such intervention, and this has helped\\r\\nkeep it below 1.60 dlrs.\\r\\n    The pound rose to 1.5870 dlrs from 1.5764 yesterday and\\r\\n1.5400 February 23, the day after the Paris meeting.\\r\\n    But Cox says the government must be worried with sterling\\r\\nheading toward 2.95 marks and would be very concerned if it\\r\\nholds around these levels.\\r\\n    He warned the Bank may run the risk of missing the interest\\r\\nrate boat. If rates dont come down, the market will say they\\r\\nought to have come down and will sell sterling, he said.\\r\\n    Most dealers agree there is a good deal of hot money being\\r\\ninvested in sterling, money simply attracted by high overnight\\r\\nor one-week rates, which could flow out at equally short\\r\\nnotice.\\r\\n    However, the authorities will hope that at least a\\r\\nproportion of the buying reflects long-term investment.\\r\\n    The last thing they want to do is reduce them (rates) and\\r\\nhave to jack them back up again, said Richard Jeffrey,\\r\\neconomist at brokerage house Hoare Govett Ltd.\\r\\n    He said a half point cut would ensure continued support for\\r\\nsterling, at least in the near term.\\r\\n    However, most analysts are still looking for a full point\\r\\nabout March 17, Budget Day.\\r\\n    The Bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to the\\r\\nBudget, said Temperton.\\r\\n    The Budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in the\\r\\nrun-up to a general election, the major factor behind current\\r\\nbullishness in the government bond and currency markets.\\r\\n    Lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget.\\r\\nHe wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest rate\\r\\ncut, said Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, the\\r\\nequities arm of Mercury International Group.\\r\\n    Speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead the\\r\\nway lower were confounded today.

contribution to Australian economic growth in fiscal\\r\\n1986/87, ending June 30, while net exports will account for all\\r\\nof the overall increase, Treasurer Paul Keating said here.\\r\\n    However, he did not say in his speech to the Economic\\r\\nPlanning Advisory Council (EPAC) if the forecast 2.25 pct rise\\r\\nin gross domestic product (gdp) had been revised.\\r\\n    But Keating said domestic demand could fall slightly this\\r\\nfinancial year and net export growth will provide the total\\r\\nsource of gdp growth.\\r\\n    The August budget had forecast domestic demand would\\r\\ncontribute 0.75 percentage points to non-farm gdp growth of 2.5\\r\\npct while net exports would account for 1.75 points.\\r\\n    Keating said the overall impact of the changed economic\\r\\nparameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to a\\r\\nslightly more rapid correction in the current account deficit\\r\\nthan first anticipated.\\r\\n    The government initially forecast a current account deficit\\r\\nfor 1986/87 of 14.75 billion -- our present expectation is that\\r\\nthe result will be somewhat lower, around 14 billion, he said.\\r\\n    Partial indicators released since the last meeting of EPAC\\r\\nin December indicate that the 1986/87 budget strategy is\\r\\nbroadly on track, Keating said.\\r\\n    They indicate that domestic demand has been a little more\\r\\nsluggish than was expected at budget time, he said.\\r\\n    On the other hand, net exports seem to be expanding by more\\r\\nthan expected at budget time, and this is underpinning growth\\r\\nin domestic production and employment.\\r\\n    Keating said it now seems likely that the 1986/87 inflation\\r\\nrate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct.\\r\\n    Nevertheless, there is likely to be a marked slowing in\\r\\ninflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetary\\r\\neffects wane, he said.\\r\\n    Keating said the government expects economic growth to pick\\r\\nup moderately in 1987/88 due to a further significant rise in\\r\\nnet exports and a very moderate but positive contribution from\\r\\nprivate domestic demand.\\r\\n    He said domestic demand growth will be due to a\\r\\nstrengthening in real household disposable income.\\r\\n    The moderate rise in economic growth next financial year\\r\\nshould be sufficient to sustain employment growth at a level\\r\\nbroadly equivalent to that of the current fiscal year.\\r\\n    The current account deficit will continue to show\\r\\nimprovement in 1987/88, Keating said.\\r\\n    As the impact of the exchange rate depreciations of recent\\r\\nyears recede further, and given continued effective wage\\r\\nrestraint, inflation should moderate markedly in 1987/88,

2.1\\r\\npct to 242 mln guilders, he added.\\r\\n    Lower global interest rates in 1986 had nipped earnings\\r\\nmargins via traditional lending activities, he said.\\r\\n    Hazelhoff said ABN was

That could send prices\\r\\n50 cts to a dollar higher, he added.\\r\\n    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate rose to\\r\\n18.15 dlrs a barrel today, a rise of 1.50 dlrs this week.\\r\\n    The rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell in\\r\\nFebruary more than two dlrs from its high of 18.25 dlrs a\\r\\nbarrel.\\r\\n    Oil traders were pulling prices down on the assumption that\\r\\noil stocks were building and OPEC was producing well above its\\r\\n15.8 mln bpd quota, but now both of those assumptions have come\\r\\nunder question, McKinley said.\\r\\n    Yesterday the International Energy Agency in its monthly\\r\\nreport said that oil stocks in the OECD area, or in\\r\\nindustrialized nations, were drawn down by 1.3 mln bpd during\\r\\nthe first quarter of this year.\\r\\n    IEA estimates that the draw in oil stocks during the first\\r\\nquarter of this year will come largely from oil companies whose\\r\\ninventory levels by April one will be an estimated 326 mln\\r\\ntonnes, or about 74 days consumption.\\r\\n    Industry analysts also said the estimate of a 3.5 mln bpd\\r\\ndraw in stocks made by Shell Chairman Peter Holmes yesterday\\r\\nfed speculation that other major companies were destocking.\\r\\n    Traders said the destocking has come about as a result of a\\r\\nso-called buyers strike, which kept refiners from buying\\r\\nofficially priced OPEC oil in an effort to get the organization\\r\\nto offer discounts to the official price.\\r\\n    This struggle between the companies and OPEC is the\\r\\nultimate game of chicken but it will be resolved relatively\\r\\nsoon. I would imagine by about the middle of the month (March),\\r\\nthe general trading manager of an international oil company\\r\\ntold Reuters in a telephone interview.\\r\\n    For its part OPEC has moved to win this game by cutting\\r\\nexcess supplies from the market by a reduction of its own\\r\\noutput, traders said. A Reuter survey estimates OPEC output to\\r\\nbe 14.7 mln bpd this week.\\r\\n    Also, an earthquake in Ecuador yesterday led it to suspend\\r\\noil exports indefintiely and force majeure its shipments.\\r\\n    This will reduce short-haul availabilities by about 250,000\\r\\nbpd almost immediately and the longer the suspension continues,\\r\\nthe larger the draw in stocks will be for companies expecting\\r\\nit to be there, McKinley said.\\r\\n    International oil traders said that other short-haul\\r\\ncrudes, such as North Sea Brent, were also scarce because Asian\\r\\nrefiners bought the oil after absorbing a lot of the readily\\r\\navailable Mideast crudes earlier this week.\\r\\n    If this pattern continues then oil companies will bid up\\r\\nthe price of oil as they purchase for their refineries, trading\\r\\nmanagers at several companies told Reuters.\\r\\n    But there were skeptics who said they wondered how long\\r\\nOPEC can retain its unity if buyer resistance continues.\\r\\n    Stephen Hanke, chief economist at Friedburg Commodity\\r\\nManagement, said OPEC production was lower because of the\\r\\nSaudi cut (to 3.1 mln bpd) and this could spell trouble if it\\r\\ngives other members an incentive to exceed their quotas.\\r\\n     He added, The Saudis will be picking up the tab for other\\r\\nmembers who produce over their quota, and the drain on the\\r\\nSaudis will continue, forcing them to cut output maybe as low\\r\\nas 2.5 mln bpd to support the 18 dlrs average price, he added.\\r\\n    There are also signs of some OPEC crudes being sold in the\\r\\nspot market at below OPEC official prices, traders said.\\r\\n    Oil traders said Nigerian Brass River sold for delivery\\r\\ninto the U.S. Gulf at a price related to North Sea brent, which\\r\\ntraded this week at 17.60 dlrs, far below the official price of\\r\\n18.92 dlrs for the similar quality Bonny Light.\\r\\n    Iranian oil is also surfacing in the U.S. Gulf and the Far\\r\\nEast at reported discounts to its 17.50 dlrs official price.\\r\\n    There is a lot of oil priced on government-to-government\\r\\ndeals, which are below official prices and this is probably\\r\\nbeing resold, one international trader said.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'MGE PLANNING APRIL 6 START UP OF HFCS CONTRACT The Minneapolis Grain Exchange (MGE)\\r\\nwill start trading futures contracts in high fructose corn\\r\\nsyrup on April 6 if the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\\r\\n(CFTC) approves the contract as expected next week.\\r\\n    Pat Henderson, spokesperson for the MGE, said the exchange\\r\\nexpects contract approval at CFTCs Tuesday meeting. It has\\r\\nbeen under review since the exchange submitted the proposal in\\r\\nDecember, 1985.\\r\\n    The proposed contract is based on 48,000 pound lots of\\r\\n55-pct high fructose corn syrup, the equivalent of one tank\\r\\ntruck of the sweetening agent derived from corn in the wet\\r\\nmilling process. The syrup, commonly called HFCS-55, is most\\r\\ncommonly used as a sweetener in soft drinks and other\\r\\nbeverages.\\r\\n    Delivery would be by shipping certificate from production\\r\\nfacilities designated by the exchange. The contract, designated\\r\\nby the symbol HF, would trade from 0900 to 1315 CST. Months\\r\\ntraded would correspond with the Chicago corn futures months of\\r\\nMarch, May, July, September and December.\\r\\n    Contract price will be quoted per hundred weight, with a\\r\\nminimum price fluctuation of one cent and maximum fluctuation\\r\\nof one dlr per CWT.\\r\\n    We hope the producers and users of fructose will be\\r\\nactively involved, those producers being the large processors,\\r\\nthe corn wet millers, and the users being the beverage\\r\\nbottlers, Henderson said.

The\\r\\namount of corn we export to Canada is insignificant.\\r\\n    The unexpected ruling appeared to be based on the agrument\\r\\nthat Canada bases its corn prices on U.S. futures prices and\\r\\nthat American farm policy has driven down these prices, thus\\r\\ncausing lower prices to Canadian farmers and larger government\\r\\npayments through its farm stabilization program, Hall said.\\r\\n    Hall said this is a new definition for injury, but that\\r\\nother nations might also now apply this same argument to attack\\r\\nU.S. farm programs.\\r\\n    The French corn growers could now charge that U.S. farm\\r\\nprograms create an unfair subsidy for corn gluten feed, Hall\\r\\nsaid. The French have long wanted to control the imports of\\r\\nU.S. corn gluten feed into the community, saying that the\\r\\nimported feed was unfairly displacing European grain.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',1\\r\\n'DOLLAR GENERAL CORP &lt;DOLR> QTLY DIVIDEND Qtly div five cts vs five cts prior\\r\\n    Payable April three\\r\\n    Reocrd March 20\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'HEALTHCARE SERVICES &lt;HSAI> SEES WRITE-OFFS Healthcare Services Of America\\r\\nInc said it will write off about 16 mln dlrs in non-recurring\\r\\nexpenses in 1986.\\r\\n    It also said it expects income from operations to be about\\r\\nbreakeven for 1986 and the estimated loss for the year to be\\r\\nabout the same as the writeoffs.\\r\\n    Results will be released by March 31, 1987.\\r\\n    Included in the writeoffs were six mln dlrs in\\r\\ndevelopmental costs, six mln dlrs in unamortized loan costs and\\r\\ndebt discounts and four mln dlrs in other non-recurring costs.\\r\\n    The company said it continues to be in default of certain\\r\\nfinancial and non-financial covenants set forth in its major\\r\\nloan documents.\\r\\n    It said negotiations continue with the banks, but has no\\r\\nassurance that such funding will continue.\\r\\n    It said it authorized Smith barney, Harris Upham and Co to\\r\\nseek a business combination with third parties.\\r\\n    Healthcare also said the board has authorized the sale or\\r\\nlease of certain assets to reduce the cash required from the\\r\\nrevolving credit line for completion of current construction\\r\\nprojects.\\r\\n    For the year ended December 31, 1985 Healthcare reported\\r\\nnet income of 3.5 mln dlrs on sales of 54.4 mln dlrs\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'USAIR &lt;U> SEEKS ORDER AGAINST TWA &lt;TWA> USAir Group said it sought the help\\r\\nof the U.S. Department of Transportation in its takeover fight\\r\\nwith Trans World Airlines Inc, asking the Department to order\\r\\nTWA to sell its USAir shares.\\r\\n    What they have done is in direct violation of the Federal\\r\\nAviation Act, USAir said.\\r\\n    It said TWA week filed a cursory application with the\\r\\nDepartment of Transportation for approval of its proposed 1.65\\r\\nbillion dlr takeover of USAir.\\r\\n    USAir rejected the offer and said it asked the Department\\r\\nof Transportation to dismiss the application.\\r\\n    USAir said it requested the dismissal because TWA avoided\\r\\npre-merger notification requirements, and also did not provide\\r\\na competitive and public interest analysis required under\\r\\nregulations.\\r\\n    USAir said if the application is dismissed, TWA would be\\r\\nlimited to buying only 1.5 pct of its 31.7 mln outstanding\\r\\nshares.

Only Kuwait has an official stock\\r\\nexchange, while other Gulf nations have yet to establish\\r\\nexchanges.\\r\\n    But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf,\\r\\ngovernments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital\\r\\nmarkets and set up domestic stock exchanges, Azzam said.\\r\\n    He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had\\r\\nclearly had a negative impact on the development of capital\\r\\nmarkets in the region.\\r\\n    In addition, family firms are reluctant to go public,\\r\\nfinancial awareness among investors is still lacking and\\r\\ninvestment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack\\r\\ndepth. A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted\\r\\ninvestors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery.\\r\\n    Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some\\r\\nGulf countries and authorities apparent reluctance to adopt\\r\\nfinancial innovations had also hampered capital markets.\\r\\n    He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation\\r\\nof joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments.\\r\\n    Azzam said capital market instruments should be made\\r\\navailable to all citizens and institutions of Gulf Cooperation\\r\\nCouncil (GCC) states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi\\r\\nArabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some moves had been\\r\\ntaken in this direction, with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals to\\r\\nown up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies.\\r\\n    Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depth\\r\\nfrom the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain and\\r\\nthe expansion of securities repurchase regulations in Saudi\\r\\nArabia.\\r\\n    But he added there is no bond market to speak of in Saudi\\r\\nArabia, Qatar, Oman or the UAE, with the last Saudi riyal\\r\\ndenominated bond issued in 1978.\\r\\n    While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading\\r\\nin Saudi Arabia has picked up, establishment of formal\\r\\nexchanges in Qatar, Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent,\\r\\nAzzam said.\\r\\n REUTER\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'POSITIVE OUTLOOK TEMPERED IN U.S. DEBT FUTURES Higher oil prices and stronger than\\r\\nexpected U.S. employment growth led to sharp losses in U.S.\\r\\ninterest rate futures and diminished what had been a positive\\r\\nchart outlook, financial analysts said.\\r\\n    The increase of 319,000 in non-farm payroll employment\\r\\nduring February was above market expectations for a rise of\\r\\n170,000 to 200,000 jobs and sparked selling in Treasury bond\\r\\nfutures that drove the June contract through key technical\\r\\nsupport at 101-2/32 at the opening Friday, they noted.\\r\\n    I dont like that fact that we had a close below 101,\\r\\nsaid Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner.

Analysts said the\\r\\nspeculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct of\\r\\nthe profitable brokerage firm to the public.\\r\\n    There was some speculation that American Express had also\\r\\nconsidered a total spinoff of Shearson, but the plan was\\r\\nconsidered highly unlikely, analysts said.\\r\\n     American Express said in the statement on Sunday that it\\r\\nwill not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesman\\r\\nwould not go beyond the statement. The company also remained\\r\\nsilent last Thursday and Friday, as rumors drove American\\r\\nExpress stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring it\\r\\nto a Friday close at 74.\\r\\n     It said it issued the statement on Sunday because a\\r\\nsimilar statement was being circulated to employees.\\r\\n    Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense for\\r\\nAmerican Express to give up a stake in the wholly-owned\\r\\nbrokerage, which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50\\r\\npct in the last year.\\r\\n    Some analysts said American Express may consider spinning\\r\\noff part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stock\\r\\nprice does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm.\\r\\n     Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express\\r\\n1.25 billion dlr net in 1986.\\r\\n    American Express ambitious plans for international growth\\r\\nmay be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part\\r\\nof Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all of\\r\\nShearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs.\\r\\n    To some however, the need for added capital is puzzling.\\r\\n(American) Express is in a position where they can raise\\r\\ncapital if they need to, said Larry Eckenfelder of\\r\\nPrudential-Bache Securities.\\r\\n    Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of\\r\\nShearson management Wednesday. Chief operating officer Jeffrey\\r\\nLane got the added, previously vacant, post of president.\\r\\n     The reorganization also created four new positions for\\r\\nchairmen of Shearsons operating divisions, a move analysts\\r\\nspeculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company.\\r\\n     Analysts, contacted on Sunday said the statement does\\r\\nlittle to clarify last weeks market speculation. It does\\r\\nconfirm, however, that the financial services firm, which\\r\\nunsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a major\\r\\nacquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls for\\r\\ngrowth and positioning in the global market competition.\\r\\n    Late last year, Shearsons takeover offer to the E.F.\\r\\nHutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton, and analysts said\\r\\nthere had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed when\\r\\nit approached another major Wall Street brokerage.        \\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'ROPAK &lt;ROPK> HAS 34 PCT OF BUCKHORN &lt;BKN> Ropak Corp said it received\\r\\nand accepted about 456,968 common shares and 527,035 Series A\\r\\nconvertible preferred shares of Buckhorn Inc at four dlrs and\\r\\n5.75 dlrs each respectively in response to its tender offer\\r\\nthat expired Friday, and it now owns 34.4 pct of Buckhorn\\r\\nvoting power.\\r\\n    The company had owned 63,000 common and 25,100 preferred\\r\\nshares before starting the hostile tender.

Hutton LBO Inc\\r\\nand certain managers of Purolators U.S. courier business.\\r\\n    Analysts have said that Purolator has been for sale for\\r\\nsome time. Purolator announced earlier it was mulling a\\r\\ntakeover bid, but analysts wrongly predicted the offer was from\\r\\nanother courier company.\\r\\n    Hutton LBO, a wholly owned subsidiary of E.F.

The rest of the shares\\r\\nwill be purchased for securities and warrants to buy stock in a\\r\\nsubsidiary of PC Acquisition, containing Purolators U.S.\\r\\ncourier operations.\\r\\n    If all the shares of Purolator are tendered, shareholders\\r\\nwould receive for each share 29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in\\r\\ndebentures, and a warrant to buy shares in a subsidiary of PC\\r\\nAcquisition containing the U.S. courier operations.\\r\\n    Hutton said in the merger shareholders would get 46 mln\\r\\ndlrs aggregate amount of guaranteed debentures due 2002 of PC\\r\\nAcquisition and warrants to buy 15 pct of the common stock of\\r\\nthe PC courier subsidiary. Hutton said the company has valued\\r\\nthe warrants at two to three dlrs per share.\\r\\n    Purolators stock price closed at 35.125 dlrs on Friday.\\r\\nWhile some analysts estimated the company was worth in the mid\\r\\n30s, at least one said it would be worth 38 to 42 dlrs.\\r\\n    This follows sales of two other Purolator units. It agreed\\r\\nrecently to sell its Canadian Courier unit to Onex Capital for\\r\\n170 mln dlrs, and previously sold its auto filters business.\\r\\n    Purolator retains its Stant division, which makes closure\\r\\ncaps for radiators and gas tanks. A Hutton spokesman said the\\r\\nfirm is reviewing its options on Stant.\\r\\n    Purolators courier business has been lagging that of its\\r\\nU.S. rivals because of the high price it paid in the past\\r\\nseveral years to add air delivery to its ground fleet.\\r\\n    E.F. Hutton will provide 279 mln dlrs of its funds to\\r\\ncomplete the transaction. This so-called bridge financing\\r\\nwill be replaced later with long-term debt most likely in the\\r\\nform of bank loans, Hutton said. Hutton LBO is committed to\\r\\nkeeping the courier business, its president Warren Idsal said.\\r\\n    Purolator lost 120 mln dlrs over the last two years\\r\\nlargely due to U.S. courier operations, which we believe the\\r\\nmanagement is turning around.

Executive Commission with a controversial plan\\r\\nfor the future of the industry which diplomats say it may be\\r\\nforced reluctantly to accept.\\r\\n    Under the plan steel output would remain subject to\\r\\nrestrictive quotas and imports would be firmly controlled for\\r\\nyears to come while steel firms undertook a massive\\r\\nslimming-down operation to adjust capacity to lower demand.\\r\\n    Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes has proposed the\\r\\nending of the quota system by December 1988.\\r\\n    He has proposed a return to the free market, which under EC\\r\\nlaw is supposed to exist except in times of manifest crisis.\\r\\n    But diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss this\\r\\nidea on March 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis in\\r\\ntheir countries, with orders falling as customers switch to\\r\\nalternative products and accounts firmly in the red.\\r\\n    Ministers from the ECs major steel producing countries are\\r\\nlikely to shy away from Narjes proposals and could back the\\r\\nindustrys own plan instead, in the hope of minimising the\\r\\npolitical impact of plant closures, they said.\\r\\n    Industry sources said the plan presented to Narjes by the\\r\\nEC steelmakers lobby group Eurofer would retain the quota\\r\\nproduction system at least until the end of 1990.\\r\\n    Eurofer said in a statement consultants working for it\\r\\nidentified scope for closing plants on a voluntary basis to\\r\\nreduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year.\\r\\n    Cuts were still insufficient in one production area, that\\r\\nof hot rolled coils, and further talks were needed.\\r\\n    Eurofer added the industry would need the support of the\\r\\nCommission and governments in carrying out a closure program,\\r\\nparticularly with social costs such as redundancy payments.\\r\\n    The EC steel industry has already shed 240,000 jobs this\\r\\ndecade while reducing annual capacity by 31 mln

Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow.\\r\\n    Viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. One\\r\\nmajor Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation. We think\\r\\nwere at the end now, in terms of bidding, said the firms\\r\\narbitrageur, who spoke on condition he not be identified.\\r\\n    Both Redstones proposal and the management proposal would\\r\\ncreate a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. The\\r\\nmanagement plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5\\r\\nbillion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred\\r\\nstock, convertible into 45 pct of the common stock.\\r\\n    Redstones newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash,\\r\\na fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a\\r\\nvalue of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stock\\r\\nstock of Arsenal Holdings, representing 20 pct of the equity\\r\\ninterest in the restructured Viacom. One arbitrageur calculated\\r\\nthe equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making the\\r\\ntotal package worth 52 dlrs per share.\\r\\n    Management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash, exchangeable\\r\\npreferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share of\\r\\nconvertible preferred. The arbitrageur said the equity portion\\r\\nwas worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs.\\r\\n    Redstones newest plan raised the amount of interest he\\r\\nwould pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond\\r\\nApril 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. The\\r\\nplan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct\\r\\nduring May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offered\\r\\neight pct interest.\\r\\n    Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the management\\r\\ngroup, led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes,\\r\\nwere offering high prices. Redstone really wants to own the\\r\\ncompany, one said. Another said management seemed to have the\\r\\nedge on the timing issue.\\r\\n    Redstones company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacoms 35 mln shares.\\r\\n    A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine what\\r\\nthe equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. He\\r\\nnoted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp &lt;FMC>, which\\r\\nadopted a highly leveraged structure last year, inititally\\r\\ntraded at 12.50 dlrs per share, dipped to nine dlrs, and is now\\r\\njust over 30 dlrs.\\r\\n    Last week, Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell two\\r\\ntwo cts per share from 23 cts. The company said interest costs\\r\\nfrom several acquisitions affected results.\\r\\n    Shares of Warner Communications Inc &lt;WCI> rose 7/8 to\\r\\n31-1/8.

failing to produce the\\r\\ngoods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left\\r\\nthe government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the\\r\\neconomy, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\\r\\nDevelopment said.\\r\\n    With gross domestic product likely to grow only 2.1 pct\\r\\nthis year, the same rate as last year, unemployment could climb\\r\\nto 11.5 pct of the workforce by mid-1988, from its present 10.9\\r\\npct, it said in an annual review of the French economy.\\r\\n    The report said the French economy was increasingly\\r\\nill-adapted to demand selling goods at uncompetitive relative\\r\\nprices on both domestic and export markets.\\r\\n    Frances poor export performance reflects a geographical\\r\\nbias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average...\\r\\nAnd...A substantial loss of market share...In the past 18\\r\\nmonths, it said.\\r\\n    Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficit\\r\\nto around 2.9 billion dlrs this year from 2.4 billion in 1986,\\r\\nit warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the\\r\\nfranc could lead to a (renewed) loss of competitiveness\\r\\nrelative not only to the United States but also to the newly\\r\\nindustrialised countries.\\r\\n    This could result in further major losses of market share,\\r\\nparticularly in the non-OECD area, which accounts for almost a\\r\\nquarter of French exports, it said.\\r\\n    Until the competitive ability of industry improved, the\\r\\nauthorities would have little scope for macroeconomic\\r\\nmanoeuvre, even if the unemployment situation or the need to\\r\\nencourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow\\r\\nmore briskly, it added.\\r\\n    But rising unemployment could help to hold down wage\\r\\ndemands, contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a\\r\\ntwo pct annual rate this year and early next, the OECD said.\\r\\n    Written mainly in December last year, the report took no\\r\\naccount of a rise in oil prices early in 1987, and a 0.9 pct\\r\\nsurge in January consumer prices, caused partly by the\\r\\ngovernments deregulation of service sector tariffs.\\r\\n    We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke\\r\\nrunaway rises, and it is not absolutely certain that bet has\\r\\nbeen lost, one OECD official commented.\\r\\n    OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oil\\r\\nprices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the\\r\\nreport, indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast\\r\\nto around 2.5 or three pct.\\r\\n    The government last week revised its forecast up to between\\r\\n2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct, against last years 2.1 pct.\\r\\n    But the OECD backed the governments view that the\\r\\nunderlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year,\\r\\nwith a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last years\\r\\nfall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of\\r\\ndisinflation.\\r\\n    With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest in\\r\\nthe OECD area, the inflation differential between France and\\r\\nits main trading rival, West Germany, could fall to just one\\r\\npct this year, it said.\\r\\n    On the other hand, the report noted, consumer prices for\\r\\nindustrial goods and private services have been rising steeply\\r\\nas companies built up their profits.\\r\\n    For the disinflationary process to continue , and price\\r\\ncompetitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange\\r\\nrate stability, it is

The improved\\r\\noutlook results from AMR Corps &lt;AMR> decision to order 40 new\\r\\nplanes powered by CF6-80C2 GE engines.\\r\\n    Creative financial footwork helped GE get the order, said\\r\\nNicholas Heymann, analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.\\r\\n    AMR declined to go into detail on financing arrangements\\r\\nfor its order of 15 Boeing Co &lt;BA> and 25 &lt;Airbus Industrie>\\r\\ntwinjet long distance aircraft.\\r\\n    But AMR said it was using rent-a-plane leases that allow\\r\\nit to operate the aircraft without adding to its debt\\r\\nstructure. AMR also has the right to decline delivery of the\\r\\nplanes or return them on short notice. The arrangement protects\\r\\nAMR in the case of an unexpected development such as a severe\\r\\ndownturn in the economy.\\r\\n    From GEs point of view the package looks like a good deal\\r\\nfor several reasons, Heymann said.\\r\\n    GE will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time of\\r\\ndelivery, Heymann noted.\\r\\n    And if for some reason AMR decides not to take the planes\\r\\nGEs financial arm, General Electric Financial Services Inc,\\r\\nwould have little trouble rounding up another airline that\\r\\nwanted the fuel efficient planes. On the whole, the deal\\r\\nappears to pose little risk for GE, Heymann said.\\r\\n    GEs stock declined 1/4 to 103-1/2 on 625,000 shares by\\r\\nmidafternoon. H.P. Smith, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham\\r\\nand Co said for a 40 billion dlr (revenue) company no one\\r\\norder will have much of an effect on the stock.\\r\\n    Russell Leavitt, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc, said the\\r\\norder will help to maintain a good level of production and\\r\\nprofitability in the aircraft engine business for GE.\\r\\n    Heymann sees operating profits from GEs jet engine\\r\\nbusiness rising from 870 mln dlrs last year to 1.3 billion dlrs\\r\\nby 1991.\\r\\n    Revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs last\\r\\nyear, with well over half of the business in the military\\r\\nsector, according to analysts estimates.\\r\\n    The rosy outlook for GEs jet engine business coincides\\r\\nwith an upbeat performance in other segments.\\r\\n    Heymann expects GE to earn 1.39 dlrs per share in the first\\r\\nquarter of 1987. Saying many will be suprised by the results,\\r\\nhe believes GE has shown through its acquisition of RCA Corp\\r\\nthat it has a unique ability to buy a major business and\\r\\nreshape it, pruning some parts and recombining parts with other\\r\\nelements of its 14 business areas.\\r\\n    Smith sees GE earning 1.35 dlrs per share in the current\\r\\nquarter.

Hutton said.\\r\\n    The next six weeks in the USSRs grain growing areas will\\r\\nbe the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of\\r\\nthe winter crops, Martell and other analysts said.\\r\\n    Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of\\r\\nus, an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said.\\r\\n    The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares\\r\\nof winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill.\\r\\nThis would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop\\r\\nand would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, the\\r\\nUSDA analyst said.\\r\\n    With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be able\\r\\nto reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analysts\\r\\nnoted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops\\r\\n-- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower.\\r\\n    Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover\\r\\ncombined with cold temperatures. This winter, however,\\r\\nsnowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent,\\r\\nso the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been\\r\\ndue to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination.\\r\\n    Fall dryness may be a problem. Theres a good correlation\\r\\nbetween mediocre crops and fall dryness, Martell said.\\r\\n    Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal\\r\\nin southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over the\\r\\nentire winter crop area, she said.\\r\\n    Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the\\r\\nsnowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused \\r\\nproblems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, senior\\r\\nforecaster for Accu Weather, said.\\r\\n    Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the\\r\\nfall and winter, analysts said. The dry fall damaged pastures,\\r\\nthe cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would\\r\\nrequire longer off-pasture feeding, they said.\\r\\n    The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... they\\r\\ndont have to buy (grains) now, a USDA official said.\\r\\n    But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops and\\r\\nif they feel that last years huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a\\r\\none-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more Soviet\\r\\nbuying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said.\\r\\n    Bad weather during the next six weeks could push the\\r\\nSoviets back into the market, weather analysts said.\\r\\n    A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and\\r\\na half, Martell said.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'ALCAN (AL) TO CLOSE WEST GERMAN SMELTER (Alcan Aluminium Ltd) is closing its\\r\\naluminum smelter in Ludwigshafen, West Germany this June due to\\r\\nhigh operating costs, an Alcan spokesman said.\\r\\n    The smelter, near Frankfurt, had annual capacity of about\\r\\n44,000 metric tons but was operating at about half that in\\r\\nJanuary, spokesman Fernand Leclerc said.\\r\\n    Leclerc said Alcan decided it would cost too much to\\r\\nmodernize the plant.\\r\\n    He said there is a possibility the company will sell the\\r\\nsmelter, which currently employs 320 people, before its\\r\\nscheduled closing.             \\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'ROYAL RESOURCES CORP &lt;RRCO> 2ND QTR DEC 31 LOSS Shr loss 72 cts vs loss 1.48 dlrs\\r\\n    Net loss 4,466,006 vs loss 9,091,688\\r\\n    Revs 608,181 vs 1,280,727\\r\\n    Avg shrs 6,194,000 vs 6,155,461\\r\\n    First half\\r\\n    Shr loss 77 cts vs loss 1.51 dlrs\\r\\n    Net loss 4,752,455 vs loss 9,265,457\\r\\n    Revs 1,444,149 vs 2,791,188\\r\\n    Avg shrs 6,174,731 vs 6,155,461\\r\\n    NOTE: Losses include charges of 4.0 mln dlrs in both 1986\\r\\nperiods vs 14.4 mln dlrs in both 1985 periods for write-down of\\r\\noil and gas properties\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'HANSON TRUST &lt;HAN> COMPLETES KAISER PURCHASE Hanson Trust PLC said Kaiser Cement\\r\\nshareholders today approved the previously announced merger\\r\\nagreement making Kaiser Cement an indirect wholly owned unit of\\r\\nHanson Trust.\\r\\n    Hanson said that promptly following the filing of the\\r\\ncertificate of merger Kaiser Cement common shares will be\\r\\ndelisted from the New York Stock Exchange.\\r\\n    Hanson also said, in accordance with the merger agreement\\r\\nKasier Cement also has redeemed all outstanding shares of its\\r\\n1.375 dlr convertible preferance stocks and its outstanding 9\\r\\npct convertible debentures due 2005.\\r\\n    The acquisitions total purchase price (including cost of\\r\\nfinancing the above-mentioned redemptions) will be about 250\\r\\nmln dlrs, Hanson said.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'OIL PRICES RISE ON SAUDI EFFORT Crude oil prices rallied today, moving\\r\\nover 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabias determined\\r\\neffort to support prices, analysts said.\\r\\n    The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market,\\r\\nhoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without\\r\\nanother meeting, said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst with\\r\\nShearson Lehman Brothers Inc.\\r\\n    But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to\\r\\nseasonal declines in demand and some cheating, he added.\\r\\n    Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt\\r\\nto get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from\\r\\nthe official prices agreed to last december.\\r\\n    The analysts said that to get others to hold the line,\\r\\nSaudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers\\r\\nof the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the\\r\\nCooperation Council oil ministers meeting the previous week.\\r\\n    The Saudis have also offered to support members having\\r\\ndifficulty in selling their oil, analysts said.\\r\\n    They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and to\\r\\nprevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC\\r\\nmember will allocate some of their oil sales to help members\\r\\nthat lose sales, Margoshes said.\\r\\n    He added that the allocations would probably be in the form\\r\\nof loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales.\\r\\n    Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line\\r\\nnations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. But it\\r\\nis also likely that such assistance would be provided to\\r\\nNigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts.\\r\\n    Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPEC\\r\\npresident Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC\\r\\nmeeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the\\r\\nDecember pact is falling apart.\\r\\n    Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Upham\\r\\nHarris and Co said, both physical and futures markets have been\\r\\noversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short\\r\\ncovering rally.\\r\\n    He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, which\\r\\nrefused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refiners\\r\\ninto the market to cover their short positions.\\r\\n    Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market\\r\\nto but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideast\\r\\nsours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading\\r\\nyeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the\\r\\nNorth sea crude oil market.\\r\\n    Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today\\r\\nthat Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent\\r\\nfor Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels\\r\\nbeing fixed to make such shipments.\\r\\n    North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades\\r\\nreported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr.\\r\\n    OPEC members denials that they are producing over their\\r\\nquotas sparked moves to cover short postitions.\\r\\n    Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC\\r\\nproduction was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last\\r\\ndecember but he gave no details on OPEC production against\\r\\nclaims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level.\\r\\n    The production probably is about their quota level and\\r\\nlargely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell\\r\\nits oil as a result, Margoshes said.\\r\\n    Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the\\r\\ncurrent rally.

This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents\\r\\na lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in\\r\\nFebruary last year following a sharp rise in international\\r\\nprices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop.\\r\\n    In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC,\\r\\nPresident Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said\\r\\nthey need to make hard commercial decisions. If we have failed\\r\\nat the ICO, at least we have tried, Dauster said, adding now it\\r\\nis time to go and sell coffee.\\r\\n    But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans\\r\\nto make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next\\r\\nmonth, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Trade\\r\\nsources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a\\r\\nprevious crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of public\\r\\nselling tenders for coffee bought on Londons futures market\\r\\nlast year.\\r\\n    A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the\\r\\nmarket in one go but is sold over a minimum of six months.\\r\\n    The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split\\r\\nbetween producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for\\r\\nfuture quotas. Consumers said objective criteria like average\\r\\nexports and stocks should determine producer quota shares,\\r\\nDauster said.\\r\\n    All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but\\r\\nconsumers insisted they did not want a return to the ad hoc way\\r\\nof settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst\\r\\nproducers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO.\\r\\n    Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and\\r\\nnon-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and\\r\\nthat Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set\\r\\nratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings.\\r\\n    It is a simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate\\r\\npolicy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome\\r\\nto participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very\\r\\ndifficult to allocate as different objective criteria achieve\\r\\ndifferent share-outs of quota, Dauster said.\\r\\n    Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO\\r\\nand at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise.\\r\\n    Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to\\r\\naccept the producers offer to abandon quotas if it proves\\r\\nimpossible to find an acceptable basis for them.\\r\\n    We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to\\r\\nencourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if\\r\\nsupplies are needed at a later stage, one delegate said.\\r\\n    Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer\\r\\nargument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO\\r\\nsession but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse\\r\\nand how much producers will sink their differences should\\r\\nprices fall further and remain depressed.\\r\\n    The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but\\r\\nboth producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real\\r\\nnegotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in\\r\\nIndonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September.\\r\\n    More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and\\r\\npolitics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could\\r\\nbring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than\\r\\nmany imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during\\r\\nthe summer.

he expected OPEC nations to\\r\\nattempt to hold prices under 20 dlrs a barrel for several years\\r\\nto keep industrial demand for residual fuel oil strong.\\r\\n    Over the next few weeks I think

happen again, he said.\\r\\n    In recent weeks, oil prices fell to the 16 to 17 dlrs a\\r\\nbarrel level on market reports of some OPE members producing\\r\\nabove their quota, pushing total OPEC production to 15.8 mln\\r\\nbarrels per day. But prices rebounded today, with April U.S.\\r\\ncrude prices up about one dlr to over 17 dlrs a barrel on a\\r\\nbelief Saudi Arabia is attempting to curb OPEC output.\\r\\n    Wellemeyer said that sharp declines in U.S. oil production\\r\\ncould push demand for OPEC oil above 20 mln barrels per day as\\r\\nearly as 1989 and up to 24 mln barrels per day by 1993.\\r\\n    Although the projected increases in demand for OPEC oil\\r\\nshould strengthen world prices, Wellemeyer said he believed the\\r\\norganization would hold its official price below 20 dlrs a\\r\\nbarrel for some time to prevent residual fuel users from\\r\\nswitching to natural gas supplies.

The disease was first discovered about six months ago.\\r\\n    Trade sources say prices might boom once again if the\\r\\ncrisis leads to output below the 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes.\\r\\nLast years output is estimated at between 133,000 and 135,000\\r\\ntonnes.\\r\\n    Researchers say the fungus could spread to other rubber\\r\\nclones if no immediate action is taken.\\r\\n    The RRI is considering asking estates to remove the trees\\r\\nseriously affected by the fungus because it was too late to use\\r\\nchemicals to kill the disease, an Institute spokesman said.\\r\\n    Senior industry and research officials met yesterday at\\r\\nPadukka, east of here, to discuss ways of controlling the\\r\\nfungus which is affecting estates mostly belonging to the State\\r\\nPlantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board.\\r\\n    The two state-owned groups account for 30 pct of rubber\\r\\nland with the balance belonging to small private producers with\\r\\na total of 145,600 hectares.\\r\\n    The RRIC 103 is a new clone propagated by the Research\\r\\nInstitute as high yielding and recommended two years ago for\\r\\nplanting. Only the two state groups seriously planted these\\r\\nclones while smallholders preferred the low-yielding but older\\r\\nPBX Malaysian clones.\\r\\n    Officials at yesterdays crisis meeting said it was decided\\r\\nto uproot only some of the affected trees while others would be\\r\\ntreated. They declined to comment on other decisions taken.\\r\\n    Trade sources said supplies had improved in the past week\\r\\nbut prices had hit their lowest since last December. If there\\r\\nis a shortage of rubber, prices are bound to rise, a spokesman\\r\\nfor a company buying on behalf of the Soviet Union said.\\r\\n    Rubber prices, particularly crepe, fell sharply by about\\r\\nfour rupees a kilo between December and March. The best crepe\\r\\none-X traded at 23.68 rupees a kilo, averaged 19.75 at this\\r\\nweeks auction. Sheet prices fell by a rupee in the same\\r\\nperiod.\\r\\n    Quantities offered at the auction also fell to an average\\r\\nof 300 tonnes per auction last month from 800 tonnes in\\r\\nDecember because of wintering in early February in producing\\r\\nareas.\\r\\n    Over 550 tonnes were offered at this Tuesdays auction with\\r\\nthe supply position showing improvements.\\r\\n    Trade sources said the smaller availability of rubber last\\r\\nmonth did not raise prices as on previous occasions.\\r\\n    Some factors, like less storage space from excess stocks,\\r\\nmeant we could not buy much at the auction until we disposed of\\r\\nthe rubber we already had, one buyer said.\\r\\n    Other sources said there were few forward contracts and\\r\\nspeculative buying last month, while delays in steamer arrivals\\r\\naggravated the problem.\\r\\n    European buyers delayed their purchases because of winter\\r\\nclosures of factories and also in the hope that prices would\\r\\nease further.\\r\\n    They said another problem that could hit the industry is\\r\\nthe dry spell in producing areas.

Future exposure would rise over the life of the\\r\\nasset.\\r\\n    The Fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balance\\r\\nconflicting needs for precision and simplicity.\\r\\n    They ignore, for example, the relative volatility of the\\r\\nparticular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts.\\r\\n    Board officials said the new gauge could increase the\\r\\ncapital required of the largest money center banks, which are\\r\\nthe principal participants in these types of activities.\\r\\n    They cautioned the Fed board to take account of the\\r\\npotential impact of the plan on the ability of U.S. banks to\\r\\ncompete in world financial markets.\\r\\n    However, the staff concluded, The credit risks inherent in\\r\\nsuch contracts now constitute a significant element of the risk\\r\\nprofiles of some banking organizations.\\r\\n    The Fed proposal would exempt all but the 20-25 largest\\r\\nparticipants in this market, on grounds the benefits of\\r\\nincluding the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs.\\r\\n    Also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchange\\r\\ncontracts traded on organized exchanges.\\r\\n    Governor Martha Seger said she was concerned that Japan was\\r\\nnot involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital\\r\\nrules.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'IDEAL SCHOOL SUPPLY CORP &lt;IDEL> 4TH QTR NET Oper shr 10 cts vs eight cts\\r\\n    Oper net 325,000 vs 228,000\\r\\n    Sales 7,070,000 vs 6,483,000\\r\\n    Avg shrs 3,313,000 vs three mln\\r\\n    Year\\r\\n    Oper shr 69 cts vs 51 cts\\r\\n    Oper net 2,124,000 vs 1,536,000\\r\\n    Sales 31.2 mln vs 22.7 mln\\r\\n    Avg shrs 3,071,000 vs three mln\\r\\n    NOTE: 1986 net both periods includes 72,000 dlr tax credit.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'SALOMON INC &lt;SB> SETS REGULAR QUARTERLY Qtly div 16 cts vs 16 cts prior\\r\\n    Pay April One\\r\\n    Rcord March 20\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'JANUARY CRUDE OIL MOVEMENTS FALL SEVEN MLN TONS Worldwide spot crude oil movements fell\\r\\nto 30.07 mln long dwt in February from 37.25 mln tons in\\r\\nJanuary and 41.44 mln in December, London shipbroker Howard\\r\\nHoulder said.\\r\\n    The decline mainly reflected a sharp drop in movements out\\r\\nof the Mideast Gulf, which totalled 7.4 mln tons last month\\r\\nagainst 11.65 mln in January.

In each case,\\r\\nfarmers would have to undertake not to step up their capacity\\r\\nfor output of other products which are in surplus in the EC.\\r\\n    The sources said payment levels have not yet been fixed but\\r\\nwill be designed to compensate farmers for loss of profit on\\r\\nthe production they forego.\\r\\n    The sources said the package also contains provisions for\\r\\npayments to farmers who embark on a program aimed at protecting\\r\\nor improving the environment.\\r\\n    It would also mean compensatory allowances in less favoured\\r\\nfarming areas would be extended to crops. At present such\\r\\nallowances are available only for livestock.\\r\\n    The package would provide 20 mln Ecus for research into\\r\\nalternative farming techniques, the sources added.\\r\\n    At a news conference EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen\\r\\nsaid the Commission is also working on proposals to enable the\\r\\nEC and member states to provide direct income supports for\\r\\nrelatively poor farmers.\\r\\n    Andriessen did not give full details, but said member state\\r\\naid would be subject to strict criteria to avoid distortion of\\r\\ncompetition.\\r\\n    EC payments would aim to help farmers to survive a\\r\\ndifficult period while the EC tackles the problems of surplus\\r\\nproduction.\\r\\n    The Commission withdrew from the package agreed last night\\r\\nproposals to pay early retirement pensions to farmers aged 55\\r\\nor over who gave up production. Those who took their land\\r\\ncompletely out of farm production, rather than passing it on to\\r\\ntheir heirs, would have received more generous payments.\\r\\n    Andriessen said the Commission plans to present revised\\r\\nproposals along these lines in an effort to get a scheme\\r\\nagreed.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'U.S., BRITAIN AGREE FURTHER BANK CAPITAL PROPOSALS The Bank of England and the U.S. Federal\\r\\nReserve Board have agreed new proposals for joint standards to\\r\\nmeasure the risk of an array of credit exposures that do not\\r\\nshow up in bank balance sheets, the Bank of England said.\\r\\n    The plan, covering swaps, forward contracts and options\\r\\ninvolving interest or exchange rates, complements proposals\\r\\nagreed in January between the two central banks to make\\r\\ncommercial banks in the U.S. And Britain subject to similar\\r\\nstandards for measuring capital adequacy, the proposal said.\\r\\n    It said no final decisions had been reached yet and banks\\r\\nhave until April 16 to comment on the trunk proposals.\\r\\n    The Bank of England and Fed said they had faced a dilemma.\\r\\n    On the one hand (we) are determined to require adequate\\r\\ncapital support for potential future exposure -- on the other\\r\\nhand (we) are concerned that overly stringent capital\\r\\nrequirements might unnecessarily affect the ability of U.S. And\\r\\nU.K. Banking organisations to price...Contracts competitively.\\r\\n     At the basis of the new proposals lies the concept of the\\r\\nso-called credit equivalent amount - the current value of a\\r\\ncurrency or interest rate contract and an estimate of its\\r\\npotential change in value due to currency or interest rate\\r\\nfluctuations until the contract matures.\\r\\n    In treatment similar to that agreed in January for balance\\r\\nsheet assets, the credit equivalent will be assigned one of\\r\\nfive risk weights between zero and 100 pct, depending on the\\r\\nquality of the counterparty, the remaining maturity of the\\r\\ncontract and on collaterals or guarantees to the contract, the\\r\\nplans showed.\\r\\n    The proposal showed that collaterals and guarantees would\\r\\nnot be recognised in calculating credit equivalent amounts.\\r\\n    They would, however, be reflected in the assignment of risk\\r\\nweights.

The consumer position would have in effect reduced the\\r\\nmarket share of Brazil, by far the worlds largest producer.\\r\\n    Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to support\\r\\nlegislation now before Congress which would allow the U.S.\\r\\ncustoms service to monitor coffee imports, as a way to comply\\r\\nwith any future coffee quotas.\\r\\n    He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing the\\r\\ncoffee policy situation following the collapse of the London\\r\\ntalks, but nobody is proposing we change our position.\\r\\n    However, other U.S. government officials involved in coffee\\r\\npolicy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market\\r\\noffensive from producer countries, led by Brazil and Colombia,\\r\\nto soften the consumer position.\\r\\n    Knowing that its next crop is fairly large, Brazil will\\r\\nkind of want to test the resolve of other producers and\\r\\nconsumers, said one U.S. official.\\r\\n    The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said\\r\\nBrazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next few\\r\\nmonths in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other\\r\\ncountries, particularly the splinter group of small producers\\r\\nwho differed with the major producers in London.\\r\\n    This in turn could lead to urgent appeals from Latin\\r\\nAmerican countries, faced with mounting debt problems, to the\\r\\nU.S. State department, and to the National Security Council in\\r\\nthe White House, for an easing of the U.S. position, U.S.\\r\\nofficials said.\\r\\n    The State department, a major player in setting U.S. coffee\\r\\npolicy, may then face conflicting pressures, particularly from\\r\\npolitically-sensitive U.S. allies in Central America, U.S.\\r\\nofficials said.\\r\\n    El Salvador and Guatemala both backed Brazil and Colombia\\r\\nat the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based on\\r\\nobjective criteria. But the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica\\r\\njoined the splinter group, which said it would agree to\\r\\nobjective criteria.\\r\\n    There is a strong feeling among some in the State\\r\\nDepartment that the United States should continue to support\\r\\nthe splinter group of producers who have taken the\\r\\npolitically-risky step of opposing Brazil on the objective\\r\\ncriteria question, U.S. officials said.\\r\\n    Within the consuming countries there also is expected to be\\r\\nsome pressure to reassess positions.\\r\\n    In London, the U.S. was supported by the U.K., the\\r\\nNetherlands, West Germany, Japan, Australia and New Zealand on\\r\\nthe issue of objective criteria, U.S. officials said.\\r\\n    This bloc represented enough votes among consuming nations\\r\\nto successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals.\\r\\n    However, U.S. sources said West Germanys support was at\\r\\ntimes qualified and there is some concern that the European\\r\\nCommunity could come under pressure to be more accommodative to\\r\\nproducers in future talks. France backed the Ivory Coast and\\r\\nother African producers during the talks.\\r\\n    A softening of the EC stance would make it more difficult,\\r\\nalthough not impossible, for the U.S. to block producer plans.\\r\\n    While political manuevering by small producers and\\r\\nconsuming countries will be important, U.S. officials said the\\r\\nkey to any future outcome will be Brazils position.\\r\\n    U.S. officials blamed Brazils intransigence for the\\r\\nfailure of the talks and said a more flexible position from\\r\\nBrasilia would be the most important step toward agreement.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'INVESTORS HAVE 12.9 PCT OF EXOVIR &lt;XOVR> Mark Hammer, a private investor from\\r\\nMelville, N.Y., and members of his family told the Securities\\r\\nand Exchange Commission they have acquired a total of 375,200\\r\\nshares of Exovir Inc, or 12.9 pct of the total outstanding.\\r\\n    Hammer said his group has been accumulating Exovir stock\\r\\nsince Oct 28, 1985 for investment purposes and may buy more\\r\\nshares or sell all or part of his current stake.\\r\\n    While he said he has no intention of seeking control of the\\r\\ncompany, Hammer said that because of his extensive business\\r\\nexperience and his interest in Exovir stock, he may be\\r\\ninvited to become a member of the companys board.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'TORRENTIAL RAINS HALT ARGENTINE GRAIN HARVEST Torrential rains throughout\\r\\nArgentinas grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarse\\r\\ngrain harvesting in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.\\r\\n    Sunflower, maize and sorghum harvests were particularly\\r\\naffected, they said.

its performance in this and other fields, Ali\\r\\nTigrel, director of economic planning at the State Planning\\r\\nOrganisation said.\\r\\n    He told Reuters the shortfall was a direct consequence of\\r\\neconomic growth of nearly eight pct, up from 5.1 pct in 1985,\\r\\nwhich he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand.\\r\\n    Tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after a\\r\\ndrop of more than 12 points to 24.6 pct in the Treasury\\r\\nwholesale index last year.\\r\\n    This years target of 20 pct might be attainable but the\\r\\neconomic management will have to be careful, he said.\\r\\n    Tigrel, whose department produces the annual programme\\r\\nwhich is central to the governments economic planning, said\\r\\nTurkeys creditworthiness was at risk over the current account\\r\\nshortfall, originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs.\\r\\n    We must alleviate the current account substantially to\\r\\nsustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secure\\r\\nover the last five years, he added.\\r\\n    His comment echoed last Octobers Organisation for Economic\\r\\nCooperation and Development report on Turkey, which said\\r\\nAnkaras case for more medium-term financing on better terms\\r\\nwould look better if inflation were lower and the current\\r\\naccount deficit cut or turned into a surplus.\\r\\n    In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sector\\r\\ninvestments, we must reduce the public sector deficit as a\\r\\npercentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visible\\r\\nimprovement in the current account deficit, he said.\\r\\n    Tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year was\\r\\nalso to blame for the high deficits.\\r\\n    Appropriations to government departments had been cut by\\r\\neight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreign\\r\\nborrowing by municipalities had been restrained.\\r\\n    We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to the\\r\\ninvestment programme and do not exceed their appropriations, he\\r\\nsaid. It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowing\\r\\nrequirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated\\r\\n5.6 pct in 1986.\\r\\n    More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was also\\r\\ntargeted, Tigrel said. Measures were being taken to encourage\\r\\nexports, and production incentives were being considered.\\r\\n    We must try to make sure that more capacity is injected\\r\\ninto the Turkish economy in the coming years. The promotion\\r\\npolicy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment and\\r\\nlocal private capital come more into play as far as\\r\\nmanufacturing capacity is concerned, Tigrel said.\\r\\n    He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkish\\r\\neconomy to free market policies, begun in 1980, was still under\\r\\nway. Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange rate\\r\\npolicy applied, but he acknowledged there was more to be done\\r\\nin a country where the state still dominates industry and the\\r\\ncurrency is only partially convertible.\\r\\n REUTER\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'ENERGY/CALIFORNIA OIL PRODUCTION Drilling for oil in California is\\r\\nlikely to continue at last years sharply reduced levels\\r\\ndespite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analysts\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n    Because much of the crude oil in California fields is\\r\\nthick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have to\\r\\nincrease to near 1985s levels before any significant recovery\\r\\nis seen in drilling, they said.\\r\\n    Companies will probably only drill their best prospects,\\r\\nsaid John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc.\\r\\n    Few new wells now are being drilled.\\r\\n    Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available,\\r\\nwere drilling for oil onshore in California last week, compared\\r\\nto about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil\\r\\nInformation Services, which tracks California drilling\\r\\nactivity.\\r\\n    Its in the dregs right now, said Bolster of the states\\r\\ndrilling activity.\\r\\n    Current prices are not enough to justify increased\\r\\ndrilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent\\r\\nProducers Association.\\r\\n    While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact\\r\\nto curb production boosted oil prices early this year, prices\\r\\neventually fell.\\r\\n    Prices for Californias marker grade, Line 63 blend, have\\r\\nslumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high\\r\\nof about 17 dlrs.\\r\\n    More than half of Californias oil comes from stripper\\r\\nwells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and that\\r\\nmuch of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to\\r\\nextract, Malmgreen said.\\r\\n    Its not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs,\\r\\nMalmgreen said.\\r\\n    Many stripper wells along the southern California coast\\r\\nproduce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inland\\r\\nwells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur\\r\\nextraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said.\\r\\n    The outlook for future production in California is clouded\\r\\nby a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said.\\r\\n    In the heart of Californias oil patch, Kern County, which\\r\\nproduces about two-thirds of the states oil, exploratory\\r\\ndrilling has slowed to a crawl.\\r\\n    Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in\\r\\n1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell of\\r\\nthe state energy commission. So far this year only five\\r\\nexploratory wells have been drilled.\\r\\n    I dont think theyll even get to what they did last\\r\\nyear, Mitchell said.\\r\\n    No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of\\r\\nthe decade, Mitchell said.\\r\\n    Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the\\r\\nnumber of producing wells and overall production.\\r\\n    Between February and October of 1986, the number of\\r\\nproducing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 from\\r\\nmore than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California Energy\\r\\nCommission.\\r\\n    In line with that decrease, Californias crude oil output\\r\\nfell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is\\r\\nexpected to remain at that lower level, analysts said.\\r\\n    Between February and October 1986, Californias crude oil\\r\\nproduction slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels\\r\\nper day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said.\\r\\n    Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986\\r\\nwas 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405\\r\\nmln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department of\\r\\nConservation.\\r\\n    Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels,\\r\\nGuerard said.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'STANDARD OIL &lt;SRD> IN TEXAS NATURAL GAS FIND Standard Oil Co said the

Analysts\\r\\nagreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they \\r\\ndiffered sharply over the carmakers long term prospects.\\r\\n    Im very positive on GM, said Jack Kirnan of Kidder\\r\\nPeabody and Co. Theyre clearly committed to enhancing\\r\\nshareholder value.\\r\\n    However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the\\r\\nbuyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to\\r\\nrecapture lost market share.\\r\\n    After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buy\\r\\nback 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. The\\r\\nannouncement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares,\\r\\nwith more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day.\\r\\n    The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the\\r\\nstock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and at\\r\\nleast one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a\\r\\ngood performance expected from new car models.\\r\\n    But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the\\r\\nrepurchase program is not a positive.\\r\\n    The buyback doesnt really change the earnings outlook and\\r\\nputs more stress on the balance sheet, he said, since GM will\\r\\nhave to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stock\\r\\nshould settle back down to around 76, he added.\\r\\n    Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and\\r\\n5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs.\\r\\nHealys numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates,\\r\\nwhich range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four\\r\\ndlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988.\\r\\n    Like other analysts, Healy sees GMs share of the domestic\\r\\ncar and truck market falling in 1987. On balance, GM cars are\\r\\nnot selling as well as their competitors, he said.\\r\\n    In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from the\\r\\nyear-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and\\r\\nChrysler Corp &lt;C> both posted increases. But GM said February\\r\\nsales showed improvement over January, adding that it expects\\r\\nimprovement in coming months.\\r\\n    Overall, GMs share of U.S. car and truck sales should fall\\r\\nto around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986,\\r\\nanalysts said. The numbers include imports.\\r\\n    Kidder Peabodys Kirnan said cost reductions and product\\r\\nimprovements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the\\r\\nfourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback.\\r\\n    GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now its rolling up\\r\\nits sleeves and getting serious. I think theres a major\\r\\nearnings surprise in the winds, he said.\\r\\n    Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, in\\r\\npart in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning\\r\\n5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. The company is more\\r\\nconcerned than ever about improving their relative valuation\\r\\nwith respect to Ford and Chrysler, he said.\\r\\n    Another positive for the stock is GMs dividend, currently\\r\\nfive dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield than\\r\\nits competitors, Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cash\\r\\ndividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted.\\r\\n    But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc\\r\\nsaid U.S. car sales will weaken, and GMs new products, if\\r\\nsuccessful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of its\\r\\nmarket share.\\r\\n    I believe their new cars will be successful, but that will\\r\\nonly curtail losses in market share, which will fall to around\\r\\n35 pct by 1990, Lucky said.\\r\\n    Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middle\\r\\nof the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock, he\\r\\nsaid results will not improve until 1988.\\r\\n    Im not looking for improvement this year. This is a\\r\\ntransition year for GM, he said.\\r\\n    Fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988\\r\\nat 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will not\\r\\naffect 1987 results. But the key thing isnt so much what they\\r\\nearn this year.

While no firm figures exist, dealers in\\r\\neurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involved\\r\\nin some swap arrangement. Separately, the ISDA estimates that\\r\\nabout 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions are\\r\\noutstanding. Kenneth McCormick, co-chairman of the\\r\\nInternational Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) and President of\\r\\nKleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said that the Association\\r\\nhas no comment and will study the proposals.\\r\\n    What they are proposing is really double counting, Patrick\\r\\nde Saint-Aignan, managing director of swaps for Morgan Stanley\\r\\nand Co, said. Instead, he argues, banks should either be\\r\\nrequired to hold a percentage of the face value -- say one pct\\r\\nper year to maturity -- or to hold a percentage of the cost of\\r\\nreplacing the contract in the event of a counterparty default.\\r\\n    The potential risk factors are very large relative to what\\r\\nwe had expected, said a director at one U.K. merchant bank.\\r\\nWhat they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now --\\r\\nto borrow money now -- to cushion you against risk you might\\r\\nhave 10 years from now, he added.(Adds title first paragraph).\\r\\n    Dealers also said they believe that banks not covered by\\r\\nthe agreement, such as those based in Japan, will have a\\r\\ncompetitive advantage because they will not have to pass the\\r\\ncosts on to customers.\\r\\n    Indeed, regulators are apparently also concerned about the\\r\\nexclusion of other countries from the new requirements. Federal\\r\\nReserve Board Governor Martha Seger, following approval of the\\r\\nproposed guidelines by the Fed, said she is concerned that\\r\\nJapan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new\\r\\ncapital rules.\\r\\n     Dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bank\\r\\nregulators recognized the concept of netting, that is,\\r\\noffsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to a single\\r\\ncounterparty against each other.\\r\\n    The paper said that regulatory authorities recognize that\\r\\nsuch arrangements (netting) may in certain circumstances reduce\\r\\ncredit risk. Furthermore, the paper said, if a netting\\r\\nagreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests, it\\r\\nmight be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly.\\r\\n    But dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an\\r\\nairtight netting agreement that is impossible to design.\\r\\n     One problem is that there has never been a major default\\r\\nin the swaps market.

its surplus with the United States last year was\\r\\n51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations, 16.7 billion dlrs.\\r\\n    The more united pressure there could be, the better, he\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n    Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation to\\r\\navoid trade disputes.\\r\\n    He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation\\r\\nearlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain and\\r\\nPortugal joined the community and its liberal imports\\r\\nregulations were tightened to conform to EC standards.\\r\\n    But if both sides drew back from the brink that time, he\\r\\nsaid, it does not mean that they would do so on another\\r\\noccasion.\\r\\n    Channon added that There is increasing reesentment in\\r\\nEurope over the U.S. tactic of negotiating under the pressure\\r\\nof unilaterally imposed deadlines.\\r\\n    He said other potential conflicts are already in sight -\\r\\nalleged European government subsidies of Airbus aircraft and\\r\\ntaxes on fats and oils -

The TWA offer was announced shortly\\r\\nafter the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin.\\r\\n    TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share. It\\r\\nalso said it was the largest shareholder of USAir and\\r\\nthreatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offer\\r\\nfor 51 pct of the stock at a lower price.\\r\\n    TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal for\\r\\nUSAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont, but it said\\r\\nit alternatively would discuss a three-way combination of the\\r\\nairlines.\\r\\n    Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairman\\r\\nCarl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into\\r\\nthe takeover arena.\\r\\n    Were just wondering if hes not just trying to get TWA\\r\\ninto play. Theres speculation on the street he just wants to\\r\\nmove onto somthing else, said one arbitrager. We think TWA\\r\\nmight just be putting up a trial balloon.\\r\\n    Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir,\\r\\nbut that the airline will probably reject it because the price\\r\\nis relatively low compared to other airline deals.\\r\\n    They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible by\\r\\nrevealing financing arrangements. They need to show their\\r\\ncommitment and their ability to finance. I think its a\\r\\ncredible offer, said Timothy Pettee, a Bear Stearns analyst.\\r\\n    I think its certainly on the low end of relative values\\r\\nof airline deals, said Pettee. Pettee estimated 58 dlrs would\\r\\nbe in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers.\\r\\n    USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer. A\\r\\nspokesman for USAir declined comment, and said USAir had not\\r\\nchanged its offer for Piedmont. USAir offered of buy 50 pct of\\r\\nthat airlines stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balance\\r\\nfor 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock.\\r\\n    USAir closed up 5-3/8 at 49-1/8 on volume of 1.9 mln\\r\\nshares.\\r\\n    Piedmont, which slipped 1/2 to close at 69-5/8, also\\r\\nremained silent on the TWA action. Piedmont has an outstanding\\r\\n65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp.\\r\\n    Norfolk Southern declined comment, but said it stuck with\\r\\nits offer for Piedmont. Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmont\\r\\nand opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover\\r\\nof Piedmont.\\r\\n    Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir to\\r\\nmake his own airline a more attractive takeover target.\\r\\n    Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and there\\r\\nwere no takers. I think the strategy might have called for\\r\\nmaking his investment more attractive. One way to accomplish\\r\\nthat specific objective is to go out and acquire other\\r\\nairlines, said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming.\\r\\n    I dont know whose going to buy them, but at least this\\r\\nway it becomes a much more viable package, said Kim.\\r\\n    But Icahns financing ability for such a transaction\\r\\nremains in doubt, in part because of TWAs heavy debt load.\\r\\n    Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to do\\r\\nthe offer.\\r\\n    The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financial\\r\\nadvisers and plans to make his own arrangements.\\r\\n   Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp &lt;X>\\r\\nand still retains 11 pct of that companys stock.\\r\\n    Some Wall street sources said the financiers USX plan was\\r\\nimpacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser, Drexel Burnham\\r\\nLambert Inc, because of Wall Streets insider trading scandal.\\r\\n    Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWA\\r\\noffer on price and financing concerns. Its littered with\\r\\ncontingencies and it doesnt even have a financing\\r\\narrangement, said one executive at another major airline.\\r\\n    But the executive conceded a merged TWA-USAir would be a\\r\\nstrong contender with USAirs east coast route system and\\r\\nplanned west coast presence from PSA. USAir could feed the\\r\\nintenrational flights of TWA, which has a midwest presence in\\r\\nits St. Louis hub. Adding Piedmont, dominant in the southeast,\\r\\nto the mix would develop an even stronger force.\\r\\n    The combined entity would also have TWAs pars reservation\\r\\nsystem.\\r\\n    Such a merger would be complex and analysts said it would\\r\\nresult in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share.\\r\\n   \\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'FOREST OIL CORP &lt;FOIL> 4TH QTR Shr loss 29 cts vs profit eight cts\\r\\n    Net loss 2.0 mln vs profit 568,000\\r\\n    year\\r\\n    Shr loss 1.37 dlrs vs profit 88 cts\\r\\n    Net loss 9.3 mln vs profit 6.0 mln\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'YEUTTER PLANS TRADE TRIP TO CHINA THIS SUMMER U.S. Trade Representative Clayton\\r\\nYeutter said he plans a July trip to China to discuss trade\\r\\nissues including Chinas admission to the General Agreements on\\r\\nTariffs and Trade.\\r\\n    Yeutter told a congressional hearing it was possible China\\r\\ncould be a member of GATT before the end of the year.\\r\\n    They are making major moves to becoming a full scale member\\r\\nof the world economy, he told the House Appropriations\\r\\nsubcommittee which oversees his agencys budget.\\r\\n    Depending on how the negotiations go on the terms of\\r\\nChinas GATT membership, Yeutter said he could put the final\\r\\ntouches on the U.S. part of the agreement during his trip.    \\r\\nThe admission of China to GATT, which is the multinational\\r\\ngroup of nations which negotiates international rules on trade,\\r\\nwould offer both potential export markets and potential\\r\\ncompetition for U.S. industries, he said.\\r\\n    That has a lot of potential as well as risks for U.S.\\r\\nbusiness, Yeutter said.\\r\\n    I think China will develop into a fine market for us, he\\r\\nadded.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'IDB COMMUNICATIONS GROUP INC &lt;IDBX> YEAR NET Period ended December 31.\\r\\n    Shr 25 cts vs 20 cts\\r\\n    Net 801,000 vs 703,000\\r\\n    Revs 6,318,000 vs 3,926,000\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'RIO COFFEE TRADE PREFERS NO PACT TO QUOTA CUT The failure of talks to introduce\\r\\nnew coffee export quotas within the International Coffee\\r\\nAgreement, ICA, was preferable to the alternative of Brazil\\r\\nhaving a sharply reduced quota, as had been proposed, President\\r\\nof the Rio de Janeiro Coffee Trade Association Carlos Calmon\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n    He told Reuters proposals to reduce Brazils quota to 25\\r\\npct of the world share from 30 pct at present were unacceptable\\r\\nas the country has large stocks and a good harvest is expected.\\r\\n    Brazil has the capacity to export 20 mln bags this year,\\r\\nCalmon added.\\r\\n    Calmon said, assuming a 58 mln bag global ICA quota,\\r\\nBrazils share under the proposals would have been 14.5 mln\\r\\nbags, of which soluble would have accounted for 2.0 mln,\\r\\nleaving just 12.5 mln bags of green coffee for export.\\r\\n    Its a pity the talks broke down, but for Brazil this was\\r\\nbetter than such a quota reduction, he added.\\r\\n    In 1985 Brazil exported 19.6 mln bags of soluble and green\\r\\ncoffee, including about two mln bags to non-members.
